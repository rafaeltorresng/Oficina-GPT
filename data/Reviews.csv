The wrong food will make him vomit or go on a grass eating fast. The ingredients in this food are quality, and the limited ingredients are easier for him to digest. I have also been told that grain free is easier on aging kidneys and liver; both of which have been a problem for my old dog. This is his favorite flavor, but the Venison is also yummy (to him, I've never tried it)"

Right away you can see the difference from a good quality food as opposed to the bargin brand.  The food is so clean and doesn't stick to the can like the cheaper ones that are filled with grease and fat and all kinds of other horrors you need to know about.  Do you know that our dogs and cats have been eating diseased animals, in addition to eating the remains of their own species who have been euthanized.  Did you know that the makers of dry dog and cat food spray used grease on the food to make it more palatable?  Well, they do.  These things and more are what we've been unknowingly feeding our pets...food so dangerous that the incidents of cancer amoung our cats and dogs is running rampent.  Quality food may cost more, but I'd rather pay a little extra than have one more of my pets die from cancer.  Do yourselves and your beloved pets a favor, feed them a good quality food.  Others besides Natural Balance include Royal Canin and Blue Buffalo, plus more.  The higher priced foods in your grocery stores (Iams, Science Diet) are on the list of BAD foods.  Do a little research, you'll be shocked by what you discover. I highly recommend this food."

The roast of the beans that went into this ground coffee looks even.  However, the acidity comes across very strong and registers as an unpleasant sourness.  The aroma is balanced and if that were the only measure I was going by then I may give 4 or even 5 stars.  The true flavor of this coffee is overwhelmed by the acidity.

I ordered the ""extreme chocolate"" cookies thinking I was up for a challenge.  Well, they are good but not great.  I can't believe I'm saying this but the chocolate is actually overwhelming.  I'm saving the rest of the bags to make a chocolate crust for my cheesecake but I won't order this type again.  I do agree that it almost tastes like the top part of an oreo but with more intense taste.  My husband hated them and my 3 year old wasn't fond of it.  On the other hand, I have been ordering the chocolate chip flavored ones.  They are awesome!  It has a perfect balance and a hint of vanilla.  My family loves it and even my co-workers too!"

Be that as it may, for some reason I don't have a problem with these cookies although they do contain sugar in the form of evaporated cane. They taste wonderful with just the right amount of spice and taste great dipped in coffee or milk if you can have that. I'd never know I was eating wheat-free gluten-free, or as my husband calls it, a ""cookie-free cookie,"" had I not read the package first. I like ginger snaps to begin with, and these taste great.

The ginger snaps were not that great to me: too sweet and sandy tasting. The extreme chocolate mini cookies were delicious! The flavor was extra-chocolately (I love dark, slightly bitter chocolate, so for me, I was in chocolate heaven) and I COULD NOT STOP EATING THEM: ate one entire bag in less than an hour....YIKES....:-) With this said, I could not give this product a 5-star rating, because I noticed the next day that my stomach was burning very much.  I don't know for certain if the culprit are the cookies, but my diet was not different aside from the cookies, which admittedly was an overindulgence on my part, so perhaps this is why my stomach was on fire. I have eaten overindulged in other foods which have not given me the same result as these. Also, they were a little too crumbly and dry,(sandy) but the taste was so spectacular that these cookies earned additional points; otherwise, I would have rated them 2 stars. So, for those with sensitive stomaches be forewarned, you may experience burning, esp. if eaten in excess. After nearing the end of the bag of these cookies, I noticed that I became satieted with the flavor/taste. I don't know if this means that I won't feel the need to eat the entire bag of the next bag. If I do, I will try my best not to eat more than 10/12 cookies a day. And, finally, these cookies also stuck to my teeth. I had to rinse with an anti-cavity rinse (twice), floss, and brush my teeth (twice) with toothpaste."

They don't quite *snap* like the wheat version of ginger snaps.  Like a lot of gluten-free cookies, they're more crumbly than chewy.  On the other hand, they do give a good kick of that ginger taste I have missed since I have began avoiding wheat years ago.  I also like that these don't have corn in the ingredients list- just rice and tapioca for flour.  So many of the GF alternatives use corn flour, which might work for Celiacs but doesn't always work for those of us who have intolerances that include corn.  I am pretty keen on the idea that I could pulverize these in the food processor and use them for a graham cracker crust.

The flavor was okay (I personally love strong ginger flavors, which I am yet to find) however, they were too sweet for my tastes. I don't know, but it seems like Americans have a strong taste for excess sugar. It would have been better if there was less sugar and more spice, as well as less sandiness and more snappiness, imho. For those who like chocolate, try the extreme chocolate cookies, but be careful as they may cause burning of the stomache; esp. if many are eaten. Not my favorite Pamela's product."

I like the fact that this product wheat free, soy free, corn free, gluten free peanut free and to top everything off it's certified kosher. In my opinion the ginger snapz tasted good ... very 'snappy' - for lack of a better word. When you are allergic to the things I am allergic to you read the labels/ingredients of foods/snacks and you notice that pretty much everything contains SOMETHING that you are allergic to. So I am grateful for this product being made. I've read several reviews and I've noticed that most of the people who gave the ginger snapz a low rating kept saying they had a sandy taste. FYI: Look at the ingredients, it contains rice flour. Rice flour has a sandy/grainy type of feeling when eaten/felt. With that being said, I let my mom and my brother taste the ginger snapz. (Both of them aren't allergic to anything whatsoever). They said that it tasted good but it left a grainy/sandy after taste in their mouths. Once again, this product does contain rice flour. With that being said, remember people - this product has no wheat, soy, corn, or peanuts. I give credit where credit is due, they stripped some of the most common ingredients that people are allergic to and still ended up with an excellent tasting snack. 4 out of 5 because after I ate about 6 snapz and got over the actual feeling of me actually eating something that I wasn't allergic to *smiles* .. I did taste the sandy/grainy-ness that people were talking about. No complains though. I can make ice cream sandwiches now, no complains at all."

The texture is great, not exactly crunchy, but not quite chewy. They have an initial crunch, a good chew, and sort of melt in your mouth, and are perfect for dunking in milk (taste fantastic with almond milk). There's no funny textures or aftertastes like with some gluten free sweets. I know a lot of people say they can eat a whole bag in one sitting, and I probably could, but I find them to be satisfying enough to just eat the serving size of 4 when I have a sweet craving.<br /><br />The price here is better than in the store, if you get free shipping.

She also told me it's good in coffee, on toast, scrambled eggs and can be used instead of normal cooking oil.<br /><br />When I put it on my face, the very next day, amazingly, the pores on my nose were smaller and almost invisible and I have large pores on my nose! I don't know how it did that, but it did. It also helped on my dry skin areas. I put in on my hair and just rubbed it in and left it and the next day when I took a shower, my hair was very soft.<br /><br />There are many uses for coconut oil and using it on your skin is only one of the things. The average daily recommendation is three tablespoons, but you should work your way up to that and not start with three because your body won't be used to it. Coconut oil helps aid good cholestrol and can help with memory loss and it has a lot of other amazing properties.

Still great on sushi!","Several reviewers point out that this product is made with horseradish, not real wasabi, and gave it a low rating because they perceive it to be ""fake"". Yes, horseradish is much inferior to real wasabi in taste qualities, but I think that is missing the point. Very few people outside of Japan know what real wasabi tastes or even looks like, so the point is moot. If you are looking at any kind of prepared ""wasabi"" product, chances are almost 100% that it will be Western horseradish (seiyo wasabi) and not Japanese wasabi. Don't expect to find 100% pure wasabi in a tube.<br /><br />Japanese routinely eat sushi with ""fake"" wasabi, so there is no stigma against it. Real wasabi is too prized and scarce to grind up in large batches and let sit around. Once grated, real wasabi loses its pungency very quickly in the presence of oxygen (within 15-20 minutes). When presented to diners, wasabi is offered as a small root placed on top of a grater so you can grind the paste yourself.<br /><br />Few Japanese people expect real wasabi except at fine sushi restaurants. Everywhere else, it's this horseradish stuff dyed an unnatural shade of green, either offered as a tube or a ball of ""wasabi clay"" made from powdered horseradish. Real wasabi is notoriously finicky about its growing conditions and difficult to cultivate. What quantities not quickly snapped up by restaurants are sold to end consumers fresh as thumb shaped roots. Availability was sporadic and unpredictable in my supermarkets when I lived in Japan, and most people are happy with buying prepared wasabi substitutes like this for everyday use. S&B tube wasabi is commonly found in Japanese grocery stores and homes. It is also included as little squeeze packets in supermarket sushi sets.<br /><br />If you ever have the chance to try real wasabi, do it! The taste is so different and hard to describe.. it has a sort of sweetness and pleasant pungency that horseradish cannot reproduce. Horseradish just gives you that powerful nasal burn. Real wasabi doesn't.<br /><br />That having been said, S&B is an excellent sushi condiment when real wasabi isn't practical or available. I have used it for many years and will continue to use it. The paste easily dilutes into the soy sauce and coats sushi and sashimi well."

We got him as a rescue from the dumpster cat rescue volunteers in our area; my husband saw this cat in a cage and absolutely just had to adopt him. (And we already had a cat. And were living, temporarily in 2 rooms. So you can imagine, it was SOME cat.  One characteristic of the Siberian is that they molt or shed fur in great quantities twice a year. It just COMES off--there is a downy undercoat that stays put and some guard hairs, but the main coat, thick and lustrous, just flies off. You should see the pile outside my office door at home--he sits there. Insane. So the cat gets hairballs. How can he help it? And he prefers to disgorge those hairballs on the BEST decorative rug we own OF COURSE; not on the linoleum in the laundry room, the wood in the entrance, or the regular wall-to-wall carpeting either, no, right smack in the center of the BEST rug.<br /><br />So something had to be done. Anyway, he needs to get rid of the hairballs and merely arfing them up isn't sufficient; cats can get a lot more hair stuck in their gut. So I got a tube of Laxatone on the vet's recommendation. While you can use Vaseline, the problem with vaseline or mineral oil is that the lubricating agent also pulls some nutrients out of the cat, and that is not healthy for them. Laxatone is rather like thick, gooey petroleum jelly, but it is fortified with  linoleic acid, linolenic acid, and peptonized iron to prevent some depletion of nutrients. It's flavored (in this case) with malt. It would seem some cats enjoy the taste of malt. (It's known some cats will lap up beer.) I think it may be that cats eat rodents, and in eating the mouse, they eat what the mouse ate, including perhaps grains that have malted in the gut of the mouse. So perhaps this is, naturally, a flavor cats are inclined to enjoy. In any case, MY cat, LOVES this. He gets the recommended dosage for his larger size, over three days, then gets a maintenance dose once a week or so. The result is a reduction in hairball expulsion and better elimination.<br /><br />If you cat doesn't like malt flavor (there is no pleasing some cats) there is a tuna flavored variety. My previous cat, an equally hairy furball of a Maine Coon, was persnickety about food and was not a snacker. She would eat the malt Laxatone to some extent, then she'd refuse it. This cat eats practically anything, so he's no trouble, and he enjoys his medicine. I enjoy the improved health of my kitty."

As long as he gets it on a daily basis, he is fine with little to no coughing and puking. Recently, I ran out of the first tube and we had to wait for the new tube to arrive.

I've only had this product for about a month and already I'm seeing A LOT of improvement!!!  I'm soooo happy for them and for me!!!  First, my girl kitty is super picky and my guy kitty will eat just about anything but the consistency of this product took them both for a loop.  They wouldn't lick it off my finger or in a bowl with treats or put on their paws either.  So, I tried putting it in their wetfood (they get part of a can for one meal per day for many other reasons but mainly bc of my picky eater kitty).  I lay the wetfood in a layer in their bowl, squeeze the laxatone in the center & fold the outer edges of the wetfood over the center filled laxatone.  They also preferred the regular malt flavor to the tuna one which is interesting bc they prefer all their wetfood to be seafood flavors.  You just have to try different ones and se what your cats will prefer, I guess.  It took them about a week to get used to it but I stuck with it and now they eat it no problem.  I had my concerns that it wouldn't work as well being given with their wetfood but as I said...I've already seen a HUGE difference...where I had to clean up the hairball throw-up normally up to several times a week...now, within the month or so that I've been giving it to them, I've only had to clean it up twice in one whole month!!  I know it'll get even better as I continue to give it to them.  Not only that but they are eating better and I can tell they feel better bc their bathroom movements are much healthier looking (hey, only a mom can say this without cringing and be sincerely happy about this, right?!) and they are moving around with a lighter bounce in their step bc they aren't throwing up as much any more either.

When it comes to instant most are drech. They're nearly undrinkable.  I even bought expensive Star Bucks instant and it was the worst I've had. Horribly bitter with a pronounced chemical taste. That seems to be how most instants are. I'm not sure how Jacob's does it but this Instant tastes like fresh brewed coffee. It has a very neutral taste, but very good and clean and inoffensive at the same time. I enjoyed this coffee so much I've convinced other friends to try it and they've enjoyed it as well.

I recall the instant coffee of MY college days and was skeptical, as we have been enjoying high-quality, freshly-ground, freshly-brewed coffee for years, but I agreed to do some research. After reading online reviews, I ordered three different kinds of instant coffee: Jacob's Kronung, Starbucks VIA Columbian, and Starbucks VIA Italian. I also picked up a jar of Trader Joe's instant. While all four types far exceeded our expectations, the Jacob's is probably the best of the lot. We brought a jar with us on vacation this past week and both husband and son preferred that over the brewed that was available.<br /><br />I'll definitely keep this as a Subscribe & Save item; in fact, I've requested an extra shipment in the interim so that we can send a couple jars to school with our son."

Now it's almost $27 with shipping and only 4 months later?  It is very good coffee and I was ready to buy more until I saw this rapid price inflation.  It was definitely the best instant I had tried--thought I'd found something I could just keep re-ordering and enjoying, but this price increase is unfathomable to me.  Other coffees have not gone up in price so quickly.  I'm afraid this price inflation will continue as Jacobs ""catches on"" more in the US market, so I really don't want to get too attached to it.  Going back to searching for another good instant.<br /><br />I have read some surprisingly positive reviews at Amazon for Nescafe Clasico (of Mexican origin) and they say it's even available at Family Dollar for about $4-5 bucks per 3.5 oz jar.  Sounds too good to be true, but it sure won't cost much to give it a try...  For this review I won't rate Jacobs below 5 stars because my complaint is with the price--not the taste.  It's a nice taste if you don't mind being taken advantage of by the distributor's greediness.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Well, I went to Family Dollar today and bought a jar of Nescafe Clasico and I must say it was really not bad!!  Since I use cream and sugar in my coffee, it doesn't have to be the greatest coffee taste out of the jar, and I think I'll be just as happy with the cheap Nescafe as I was with the expensive JACOBS.  Yeh, I know I'm a bit of a cheapskate, but the taste of the Nescafe was really quite good!"

I enjoyed it very much. I left the tea bag in as I drank the tea (the whole time, much longer than recommended), which turns most teas bitter, but not this one. So far, this has been my experience with all of the St. Dalfour's teas that I have tried, a big selling point for me since I enjoy my teas very strongly brewed.<br /><br />St. Dalfour is a French firm that makes natural teas, including this organic tea. There is not a lot of information about them on their web site beyond the basics, but what is there looks good.<br /><br />St. Dalfour's Organic Strawberry Tea is a nice variation on plain black tea.

I was a heavy coffee drinker and after reading multiple reports and articles about the benefits of tea along with a desire to cut back on my caffeine a little bit I started to try a bunch of different teas. In the past year I have tried perhaps twenty different types, green, puerh, black, herbal, etc. For the most part I seem to gravitate towards the black teas, I suppose their caffeine is waht I like though it is nowhere near that of coffe. With coffee I would drink a full strong pot and then shake like a leaf and crash hard when the caffeine wore off, the nice part about this stuff is that you can drink it more or less all day long and you never get shakey and I never crash from it afterwords either!! It keeps me feeling alert, is mild tasting, and arromatic. It doesn't taste really of strawberries so much as it smells like them, but it is a very good tea. After buying this one box I came back and bought a bulk pack of six boxes and have already burned through almost half of those. Good stuff!"

A staple in our house.","This soup is not only high in Vitamin A and C but is great to have on hand for a quick lunch or dinner, either alone with supplemented with bread or crackers and a salad. It is also completely gluten-free.<br /><br />Imagine this: you're hungry, don't have anything on hand, don't want to out and buy groceries. With a 12 pack of this on hand (currently averaging $2.50 a can but a deal because it is so filling), you simply need to open the can, heat it and add whatever you want to offset the low sodium - unless you are on a low-sodium diet. I'm NOT on a low-sodium diet and don't mind the lack of salt. However, if you want a stronger or saltier taste, you can add a bit of regular or garlic salt or salt substitute. I also prefer to add a dollop of sour cream or low-fat yogurt and that makes a HUGE difference. With some crackers, I'm set for lunch or even dinner.<br /><br />Look below for the nutritional content and other benefits but don't overlook those impressive amounts of Vitamin A and C. Sure, you'll need more for your daily requirements but this doesn't have that horrible preservative taste of other canned soups and my whole family loves it. I sometimes add a bit of chicken or vegetable broth and add some lightly sauteed onions or celery. But none of that is necessary. Good to have on hand for power outages, blizzards or times when you need food and the stove won't work. It can be eaten cold in a pinch.<br /><br />Other pros:<br /><br />1. No trans fats, MSG or preservatives. NO GMOS, no bio-engineered ingredients.<br /><br />2. Tastes a bit bland by itself (low sodium) but add some pepper, a bit of salt and a dollop of sour cream and yogurt and it is elevated to a far tastier soup.<br /><br />3. Great to have on hand for emergencies or when you're rushed for time and need a quick meal. Perhaps hearty eaters would want more but I find a can to be totally satisfying and hearty enough to keep me full till dinner or eve as a dinner entree.<br /><br />4. My whole family likes it but they do prefer salt. So take a chance on this and see if your family likes it. If they do, having this on hand could be a major time saver and you'll know they aren't getting trans fats.<br /><br />5. Relatively high vitamin content compared to other commercial soups.<br /><br />Nutritional content (daily values): Vitamin A- 45 percent, Vitamin C - 20 percent, Calcium - 6%, Iron - 15%, Fat - only 4 grams (no trans fat and only .5% of saturated fat), no cholesterol, 340 mg sodium, 24 grams of carbs, dietary fiber 32%, protein - 7 grams, sugars - 5 grams.<br /><br />We find that if we have this soup before a larger meal we don't feel inclined to eat as much. If you are trying to lose weight, this is a plus. Each can is around 360 calories unless you want to stretch this to 2 servings. I don't prefer to do that but if you have toddlers or very young children, half a can should be plenty. I'm sold on this wonderful soup!"

The LIGHT was very good, but the Low Salt(this one) was the one I prefered in taste,texture and ingredients. And it wasn't just the small difference in the sodium levels per serving - this one at 340mg, the Light at 290mg - you could always add a tiny bit more or doctor it up if you want with pepper, or Mrs. Dash no salt seasonings - this one just seemed more like a stew and had ingredients the LIGHT did not have. This one has tomatoes and spinach which really adds something extra.And really I found that it needed no doctoring up at all.<br /><br />I liked the Light in Sodium and would recommend it as well to anyone looking to reduce their sodium intake. All Amy's soups are great and made with all organic ingredients. The Lentil soups are also a good source of protien and dietary fiber. They are also a good source of Vit A,and Iron. O Cholesterol, low fat and low sugar as well.<br /><br />You can check the nutritional info(click on link on detail page) and also see all the ingredients and decide for yourself which you want to try, but I wanted to let everyone considering know that there are 2 different lower sodium lentil soups. I prefered this one.It was thicker and just had that little something extra.<br /><br />Also - I found that buying them here by the case saves quite a bit as compared to the individual cans at my local market.

All of them are great.  If you are just now switching to Low salt or no salt you may find them to be bland until your body adjusts to the lowered salt intake (that could take months or up to a year).  The biggest complaint most have is the dented cans.  My Minestrone and Chili came in without any dents, the Pea Soup had 2 dented cans and the Lentils had dents in every can.  These dents are not caused by shipping.  All of my shipments came in with the packages totally intact with no signs that the outer shipping box had been roughed up in shipment.  These dents are caused by Amazon or Amy's warehousing.  The cans are not in boxes, they are shrink wrapped so when stacked the cans are actually bearing the weight.  Too much weight and the cans begin to buckle and this buckling will look like dents.  You can also get this same effect if the warehousemen are slamming the 12 pack cans down hard on top of each other.  This happens when workers in the warehouse get tired and become careless, are untrained, or just plain don't care about their job.  If you want to feel better then stay on a low salt diet, if you have ankle swelling then get on a low salt diet and get checked for congestive heart failure.  If you have high blood pressure get on a low salt diet and then increase your intake of magnesium.  Backing off your salt is not easy as it begins to change the way you taste food but if you stay with it and get off the high salt diet you will begin to taste food and not just the salt.  Have you ever eaten at a restaurant where the cook's salt intake is so high that the cook can't tell if he has too much salt in the food he is preparing?  I have more than once and it just destroys the meal.  Instead of buying 12 cans now try the Amy's Low Salt by getting it at your local health food store one can at a time then if you like order from Amazon and save.  Right now they have a 25% discount code when you order.  Write it down and use it as it saved me a few bucks.  Hope this review helps you."

I wanted to put them out in a bowl for Christmas guests, but I'm afraid that many would-be consumers would think it spoiled and would not eat it.  I'm keeping it in my private stash.  I have seen this before in either old product or product that has been exposed to excessive heat and then recooled.  My friend took two of the bags over to his house and I haven't discussed the quality of those bags with him, so I don't know if his bags contain the same degraded contents.

It is low in fat and calories (The whole can has 9 grams of fat (probably mostly from the olive oil) and just under 300 calories) and it tastes GREAT.  Other reviewers have mentioned the dented cans.  Since we eat so much soup, we buy exclusively from amazon because of the price. We have recently encountered the dented can problem (not only from this product, but other canned items as well: chili, fruit, etc) but the occurence of the dents versus the number of items purchase is minimal. All in all this soup is a GREAT product.  I give it four out five stars because of the dent issue, even though we still buy this product quite frequently.<br /><br />If you are looking for other good tasting soup from Amy's some of my other favorites are as follows:  Light Sodium Chunky Tomato Bisque, Curried Lentil, and Black Bean Vegetable.

Like most of the Amy's line, the manufacturer does not skimp on the important ingredients.  This soup is chock full of vegetables. It is thick and has a nice texture and vegetable diversity. While the soup is heavy on vegetables and lighter on broth, the broth that is in the soup is somewhat oily. (This tends to be an issue with many Amy's soups save their chili options and a couple of pureed vegetable options).<br /><br />So why the three stars?  It comes down to personal preference.  My problem with the soup is attributable to one ingredient and that is the chipotle pepper. Chipotle pepper can add a smokey component to foods and it was definitely present with the Fire Roasted Southwest Vegetable.  I had hoped that the chipotle essence would be subdued given its low spot on the ingredient list, but it wasn't.<br /><br />This is a filling soup and when paired with a slice of crusty bread, you have a meal.  Adding some brown rice would yield an even more filling soup for the more hearty appetite.  I did not find the soup to be hot but for reference I eat a lot of spicy Indian curries.<br /><br />This is a vegan product.<br /><br />Ingredients: Filtered water, organic tomatoes, organic roasted potatoes, organic fire roasted corn, organic black beans, organic fire roasted onions, organic carrots, organic fire roasted bell peppers, organic celery, organic green chilies, organic extra virgin olive oil, sea salt, chipotle peppers, spices, organic black pepper, organic onions, organic balsamic vinegar.<br /><br />I purchase Amy's Kitchen soups at my local co-op for about 2.50 a can.

Not overpowering but spiced enough to give the soup & its mixed flavors a standing ovation.  Not many 'canned' soups can taste homemade while still maintaining its flavors.  Bottom line?

A recent renovation left me temporarily kitchenless and at the mercy of the packaged food aisle, where I opted for the organics hoping for a slightly less appalling<br />palate experience.  While the rest of the Amy's soup series was a slightly uneven affair, the roasted vegetable, to my great relief, proved highly edible.  Like any processed food, it benefits greatly from a little doctoring - fresh lime zest, chopped cilantro, creme fraiche or any combination thereof introduce fresh notes that nicely complement the smoky overtones of this soup, and elevate a decent comestible to a quite fine one.  A few spoonfuls of leftover rice, quinoa, small pasta, baked tofu, etc tossed in can add substance, and easily stretch a can to 2 generous servings.  If you're going to keep some canned soup on hand for those too-tired-to-cook winter evenings, it should be this one.  Enjoy!"

My husband loves them enough to eat them cold out of the can, so he'll take them to work for lunch or sometimes have a late night snack (usually in the single-serving versions -- at least better for him than potato chips or candy bars!). We also use them as a side dish for pork and sauerkraut meals. In addition to just microwaving them in a bowl (or eating them out of the can!), here are 3 other great ways to cook them:<br /><br />1) Put in an ovenproof dish and bake alongside anything else in your oven. They'll only get better. We put pork and sauerkraut in one open dish and these in another and leave them both in a 400 degree oven for about 50 minutes with excellent results (try putting sliced sweet onions misted with a little olive oil and sprinkled with salt and pepper into a third dish for an awesome vegetable side!).<br /><br />2) If you cook pork chops, hot dogs, sliced ham or kielbasa in a skillet, add these beans to the skillet around the pork and let the flavors mix as both are browned and heated.<br /><br />3) To feed a crowd, heat contents in a slow-cooker, add your choice of flavorings (onions, celery, carrots, brown sugar, mustard, ketchup, garlic, diced tomatoes, etc.) and/or meat (chunks of ham, hot dogs, kielbasa, whatever), and bring on the hungry hordes! Can leave on keep-warm in the slow cooker literally for days -- great for feeding a work crew that's cleaning up storm damage or running a charity event.<br /><br />B&M is a famous maker of baked beans, very hard to find these days, and we're thrilled to be able to obtain their products through Amazon.

After we tried them, however, we donated the remainder to a food pantry which is probably what I will do with these too (non-returnable due to being a food item). I think that B&M may have consolidated their line and doesn't offer both anymore, but the Amazon product descrition is misleading in any case. Just because my family didn't like the flavor though, yours might. In general we love B&M products and living in Arizona, they are hard to find, so finding them on Amazon is a bonus."

Gum chewing also stimulates saliva release and any natural saliva that can be produced is of benefit.<br /><br />This is a great product for those with dry mouths and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Jim ""Konedog"" Koenig, DDS"

You have to chew two and a time, and that costs about $.20 per use at the listed price, not including shipping. The gum is boring and small and doesn't retain flavor or the texture I like, so I don't chew it very long when I use it. I don't like hard gums like Dentine or bubble gum; I usually use a soft sugar free gum like Extra.  It's cheap and comes in lots of flavors and stimulates saliva flow. I'm not a big chewer, I mostly suck on it, or let it sit in my mouth.  Biotene may be better in terms of mildness, but I love flavored gum, and am not willing to shell out so much to keep buying Biotene gum. (I do like Biotene toothpaste , though.)"

I am impressed with this gum because of its way of using natural enzyme protection to relieve dry mouth and protect your teeth from decay during cancer treatment.<br /><br />Oh yes, it's true--the gum loses it mild mint flavor pretty quickly--after just about a minute! However, if you want to protect your mouth during chemo, it certainly couldn't hurt to at least chew this gum some of the time. It beats getting cavities. At 44 I still have no cavities and I'm not about to start now!<br /><br />You do need to chew two pieces of this gum at the same time. One piece will be too small and you could accidentally swallow it, I suppose.<br /><br />The two pieces of gum have a total of five calories, so don't be concerned about that. It is sweetened with xylitol.<br /><br />Overall, this gum can save you from dry mouth and tooth decay during a course of cancer therapy such as chemo. It may work well if you need radiation therapy, too. It's not a fun type of bubble gum, (how I wish that it were) but it does what it sets out to do--protect your mouth from decay during a course of chemo treatment.<br /><br />Ask your dentist if you have any questions."

I can enjoy food in moderation that I was denying myself.  I say moderation, because xylitol can cause soft or even liquid stool if you overdo it.  It's not safe for pets because they get severe hypoglycemia quickly which can kill them, especially puppies and kittens.  What I do is mix this with stevia drops and I can then use that concentration for coffee and tea all day without ill effects.  I feel I need to address some reviews that people have on xylitol, not necessarily from Now foods specifically.  I am concerned about people buying a new product without checking what it is and then giving it bad reviews for effects written clearly on the bag.  It would be different if the manufacturer was being deceptive but honestly, don't feed your kids something if you don't know what it is and then want it taken off the market.  For some people this is a miracle food.  Research any food you are going to put into your body or even bring into your home.

High quality xylitol made from corn, not birch.<br /><br />However, this stuff is very toxic to dogs.  Don't let them have any of it, not even small quantities.  If you want a sweetener like this but without such toxicity to dogs, get Erythritol.  Same sort of thing -- a sugar alcohol, but not dangerous for animals.  Also, it does not have the same digestive effects (gas, bloating, diarrhea) that Xylitol does.  It is maybe a little less sweet than Xylitol, however.<br />This does not mean it is bad for people - for example, chocolate is fine for people but also toxic to dogs.<br /><br />Note:  When I do buy it, I use this company.  I've ordered Xylitol and Erythritol from them and they were VERY high quality.  When I tried it from EmeraldForest, I found some products had a horrible, strange smell and faint aftertaste.  I called to return the items and was treated very badly by their customer service.  EmeraldForest is getting some of their products made in China (not all - their xylitol apparently not), and I wondered why it has that horrible odor.  Kinda scary.  Also, their customer service is very bad.  If you check their terms and conditions, you will see something sort of unusual for an online merchant:  ""We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone..."".  When I tried to return the odd smelling product to them citing their money back guarantee, they went around about it and then finally agreed, but said then they would never sell anything to me ever again (!).

Being a fruit lover who used to eat lots of fruits on a daily basis, I started looking for a safe way to have sweet stuff without feeding the microorganisms that have been for so long attacking my system. After a lengthy research of more than a year, I found out that though most sweeterners FEED bacteria and Candida Albicans, Xylitol DOES NOT. I started using Xylitol regularly and found out, to my surprise, that my worst Candida symptoms were GONE. The symptoms would recur every time I had fruits (darn!)or something made with refined sugar or other sweeteners like Splenda or Stevia, or even the Aspartame that is used on Diet Drinks. Whether I liked it or not, it became clear to me that I could not eat or drink anything sweet, that I could neither have any fruits and that I could not drink any diet sodas. I have intensely and extensively ""tested"" Xylitol for over a year and I can AFFIRM without a doubt that it is the ONLY sweetener I can use without getting my symptoms back.<br />I buy chocolates made with Xylitol on a regular basis and I use this brand of Xylitol to make chocolate bread and all kinds of cookies. I also make healthy chocolate ice cream with Xylitol, unsweetened cocoa powder and soy milk. If it were not for Xylitol, I would not be able to put anything sweet in my mouth. One of the most recognizable and annoying Candida Albicans symptoms was that I had to get up every one or two hours every night  to urinate (!!). It was a nightmare, but it helped immensely when it came to ""testing"" what was good or bad for me. Conclusion: If I stay away from all types of sugars, natural fruits, fruit juices and sweeteners, and only use Xylitol-sweetened stuff, I feel much better in every respect and, very importantly, I can sleep 6 or more hours in a row without waking up to go to the bathroom."

I am very particular about having sugar in my coffee with no after taste and Xylitol is the only sweetener that I have tried that is identical to sugar. I like stevia better though for quick dissolving e.g. for salad dressings and cooking enhancements because it disolves better in cold cooking and it's aftertaste is covered up, but for hot foods such as putting it in cocoa and coffee there is an aftertaste but not so with Xylitol. Also I like the crunchiness of sugar which Xylitol has, and really have enjoyed eating strawberries dipped in it,  not to mention cinnamon toast. I only wish that they could manufacture the product with a more finer texture like the consisteny of cane sugar. Xylitol makes a great maple syrup when heated with water and mixed with maple flavoring. It dissoves very well with heat, great for syrup for corn fritters,french toast, and pancakes. I do not put a lot of syrup on my fritters since I am a little leary of it being so harmful to dogs(are we all that different?). This is my only worry.

We were buying the small bags of birch xylitol, but went looking for something else due to cost. We are a family of three and all of us love yummy, sweet, creamy tea.

Bakes like sugar in the recipes we have done. It isn't quite as sweet as sugar and since we've been used to using it almost exclusively our taste buds have gotten used to it. Now, when I go out and I am offered a treat, or get one at a restaurant, I can't take the sweetness. I've gotten so I never eat dessert or snack on sweet things. I just don't like them anymore. I'm healthier and my husband is healthier. My son, who is seven, also never snacks on sweet things or even asks for them (with the exception of ice cream, sometimes). I think this is because he is used to not having them around. If he wants a snack he usually asks for things like crackers and goat cheese or fruit. I only mention this about my son because I have noticed that his peers are always snacking on really sugary things, things that now make my taste buds shudder.<br /><br />Cons:  The large size is a bit unwieldy and the zip-lock type closure doesn't work very well, at least on ours. Since I am a stickler for not having our food open to the elements we have had to invest in a large container for food storage.

In contrast to sucrose, or table sugar, whose glycemic index is 100, xylitol's glycemic index is just six.The key to xylitol's benefits is that it helps to break down biofilms. Brushing with xylitol , chewing xylitol gum, or sucking on a xylitol pastille several times a day has an anti-biofilm effect, according to researchers. Without the protective biofilm, bacteria just can't adhere to the enamel and release corrosive substances that cause cavities. Additionally, the bacteria that cause periodontal disease have no place to hide in the gum recesses."

It is very much like sugar in taste and form - and offered a terrific way to deal with my preference for sweetened tea and coffee. (Several of my doctors specifically recommended that I do not use Splenda or any other artificial sweetners.)There are some gastrointestinal side effects to Xylitol however.<br /><br />A product called ""Z Sweet"" was introduced to me as an alternative to Xylitol ... Z Sweet uses Erythritol mixed with a bit of Stevia (though there is NO licorice aftertaste at all). Erythritol seems to have all the same advantages as Xylitol, but has fewer side effects. The taste is nearly identical - though I prefer the Z Sweet combo. If memory serves, Z Sweet/Erythritol is not dangerous to dogs.<br /><br />If you find Xylitol useful in your life, as I do, you might want to know about Eryithritol (or Z Sweet) in addition."

Using my Victorio's grain mill to grind the wheat into a fine flour has produced some of the best bread we've ever baked, or eaten, hands down. To give it a decent shelf life, and to keep it safe from weevils or grain moths, I've packed it in a 6-gallon food-grade plastic storage bucket with a mylar liner, and a dessicant packet inside. This price is great for organic hard red wheat. We're beginning to experiment with cooking our breads in the Global Sun Oven (also purchased here at Amazon), for those times when the power might not be available in an blackout or an storm-driven outage. Since my grain grinder is a hand-grinding model, power outages won't be a problem in baking daily breads."

You get totally fresh flour (after you grind it) and if you make bread once a week, 50 pounds of wheat berries will last a year.  If this is more wheat berries than you'd like to buy, get the 25 lb. bag instead of this size.  (Just be sure you have some secure plastic containers to keep the wheat berries in.)  At this price (and with this quality) it's an unbeatable deal!<br /><br />If you don't yet own a flour grinder, I recommend the KoMo machine made in Germany.  It's costly but it comes in a beautiful wood cabinet.  And if you eat granola, you can grind your oat groats (the whole grain product) on a daily basis - giving you something both cheaper and tastier than rolled oats (which are very processed).<br /><br />Great River is an excellent company!

I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor.

I had to be put on pitocin (without meds for the first 14 hours) then I got the meds and then got the epidural about 45 minutes before I actually gave birth. Let me tell you, I only pushed for about 20 minutes and I was done. I attribute that 100% to the tea.

While the rose flavor is still there, you have to really search for it. I think it takes a few cups to do that because this is primarily a fruity tea. After you knock the first few cups down and find the subtle rose flavor, you'll find that it tastes like what a rose would taste like if it were a fruit. Which is basically what rose hips are. After drinking this entire box, I found that I really liked it. I was sad when the box was gone and I do intend to get some more soon.<br /><br />Just as an added note, I feel this needs to be mentioned.

I have a cupboard full of treats I felt comfortable giving her that she ended up saving so she could play with them later. So, out of desperation, I bought these; a treat is, after all, a treat. And she goes berserk over them. She's runs to the kitchen whenever I simply open a cupboard, hoping I'm about to give her one of her precious treats. I've also finally taught her to Come on command! And, to be honest, other treats (including this brand's regular treats) have a lot worse ingredients."

I give each cat 2 of the treats in the morning, and they gobble them up.<br /><br />I gave these 5 stars because they serve their purpose well, which is making my cats think they're getting something special every day.  Keep in mind, these are not as healthy as some of the high end treats that contain no meal or by-products, so I don't want to mislead anyone on the health value.  Moderation and coupled with a high quality food, these make a nice little treat.<br /><br />Once these are gone, I will try some of the other flavors in the All Natural line; however, the Free Range Chicken Flavor will always be in my cupboard.

With a few rare exceptions, it is hard to find cat treats that are popular with mostly all of the cats.  So far, Natural Temptations Wild Alaskan Salmon Flavor, Natural Temptations Tuna Flavor and All Natural Temptations Chicken Flavor are proving to be three of the rare exceptions.  Just about all the kitties love these things and will follow me around when I'm handing them out so they can cadge more.  Because they are all natural and only 2 calories per treat, they are a reasonably safe and nutritious treat.  Because they are inexpensive, I can afford to bring enough for everybody at every visit!  And apparently they taste awesome.  I can buy these at my local grocery, Target, Walmart or pet store for around $1.50 to $2.00 a packet and each packet contains enough treats to provide every kitty in the shelter with a generous serving of treats. There is one negative - these treats contain a lot of grains and as a result some kitties will vomit them up after an hour (some kitties tummies will not tolerate food or treats containing grain, or more than very small amounts of grain); over the last few months I've had 3 or 4 kitties through the shelter with this issue.  Once I've identified a kitty who is grain-intolerant, I naturally do not feed it these treats or anything similar.  Note that there are several versions of the Whiskas treats that are not all natural; the kitties like them also but I prefer to feed the all natural version."

I bought these cookies in January of 2010, and they are good until 9-2010, which is important to me, since I hate eating rancid food, so I just throw it out.  I've always loved these cookies, and my market sells them for much more than the subscribe price, so I'm happy to subscribe and save.  I love currants, and it's hard to find things flavored with them.  I have to admit, the currant taste is not strong, but they are delicious anyway, and I love the puff pastry.  Further, I'm allergic to GMO corn starch (genetically modified corn starch)- and just try to find cookies in US stores without corn starch (and 95% of all corn is modified in the US, and does not have to be labeled so).  So these are a real treat for me- since they are a cookie I can actually eat.<br /><br />The cookies are flaky, as puff pastry always is, and slightly sweet.  As other people have said, this is not a terribly sweet cookie, but it is quite sweet enough.  I enjoy mine with tea, and I also take them in my lunch.  If you take them in your lunch, put them in a little box- because they ARE delicate, and you might end up with delicious crumbs if you don't protect them.  I know this because I squashed them once."

Well, I'm pleasantly surprised to say it actually does taste great.  The milk does have a very very slight different taste from milk you would get in your supermarket, but in no way does that take away from the milk.  I drunk it when it was over room temp and then when it was cool.  It tasted better cold, but it wasn't bad warmer either.

I had to try it.<br /><br />I bought the white milk and the chocolate milk, that comes in handy for those midnight chocolate cravings!  The chocolate milk is pretty tasty.  It doesn't taste exactly like the Nestle or Oak Farms chocolate milk I'm used to.  It doesn't seem as rich, but it was an easily acclimated taste.  I've used the white milk on Frosted Flakes and to make Kraft Mac & Cheese so far with great results.  The mac & cheese had a nice tang to it.<br /><br />If you are used to drinking Organic, Reduced Fat Milk, this product will probably taste no different to you.  If you don't usually drink this type of product, there is a slight taste variation, but is quickly overlooked.<br /><br />It is a bit more expensive buying milk this way, but if you are anything like we are, the added expense is worth it for the convenience of always having unspoiled milk available and being able to grab one on the go.

My wife was concerned that we were spending a lot more for organic milk and she did not think we could tell the difference.

Due to a severe illness as an infant I was taken off dairy products (doctor's orders) at 6 1/2 months and according to family I refused to drink milk again.  I use milk in cooking and try to eat cereal and oatmeal with milk to get my calcium but couldn't use 1/2 gallon before it ruined and I really hate to waste food.<br /><br />I began reading about shelf stable milk and liked the idea IF and only IF it tasted like real milk.  I searched Amazon and debated several days before trying Horizon Chocolate Milk.  Chocolate Milk is the only milk I will drink and again I can't drink 1/2 gallon or even a quart before it ruins, although I try.  When I saw the additional discount offered I decided if ever I was going to try it, now is the time.  IF it tastes like real milk and can be stored without refrigeration until ready to use it would be a win win situation for me.  Well......<br /><br />UPS brought my milk today and not only did I try it, I asked my teen-age son who LOVES milk to give it a try.  He couldn't believe it when I told him UPS delivered it from Amazon and that it didn't have to be stored in a refrigerator until it was opened.  As for me....I LOVE IT and can't believe I waited this long to try it.  It tastes better than the chocolate milk I purchase at the store.  As far as price-I can't give an accurate price comparison as this milk is not sold locally in my small hometown.  I've seen other posts mentioning price and I think the 15 I paid for it to be delivered to my door is an excellent price.  I can already appreciate the convenience of having the 8 oz containers that I can toss in my office refrigerator, a lunch box or just grab on the way out the door as a quick breakfast.  Being able to open only what I plan to drink is just way better than I can describe. I would give it more than 5 stars if possible.<br /><br />Great milk (organic), delivered to your door, stored without refrigeration-I couldn't ask for more."

The portion sizes are pretty weird too, I'm not a calorie counter but a couple months ago I glanced at the side of a chocolate milk drink to discover the whole bottle had over 500 calories!

I have been trying to move myself away from fattier, oily snacks during my day and sugary sweet drinks to wash them down. I thought Sun-Chips were pretty good, and buying chocolate milk from the Cafeteria filled it in. I wanted to do better, though. I have now been drinking a lot of Vita Coco to help fill the void, but it can be so expensive and sources which are decently-priced are endangered. This was a questionable purchase at first, since I have been drinking skim milk for 15 years now, so I am used to and prefer the cold, crisp, lighter flavor. I am glad I went for it!<br />Pros<br />-Love the packaging! Does seem to keep flavor better than traditional small milk cartons.<br />-Smooth and rich flavoring. Chocolate is richer in flavor than vanilla. My wife says the vanilla has an after-taste, but I disagree. So it is apparently subjective. I have yet to try the strawberry, but if I were a betting man, I would say the same is true for it.<br />-Better sugar and fat contents than generic milk packages. I have read other reviews that criticize this, but I am not sure what they have been drinking instead. All regular milk has sugar. It is really not that much.<br /><br />Cons<br />-You might be of those who think the sugar content is too high.<br />- The flavor is different than any I had had before. Any new flavor can be a tough adjustment. Sometimes, that adjustment never completes (I think this one is worth it, but I adjusted very quickly)."

Since Amazon doesn't show all ingredients, I had to look them up at the store, and I was shocked when I saw Carrageenan as one of them on this milk!! CARRAGEENAN: a seaweed derivative used in a wide variety of foods and cosmetics. In its native form, it has not been classified as a carcinogen, but in it's degraded or broken down form it has been classified as a possible human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Joanne Tobacman, M.D., University of Iowa assistant professor of clinical internal medicine, and researcher on carrageenan, said ""There seems to be enough evidence associating carrageenan with significant gastrointestinal lesions, including malignancies, to avoid ingesting it."" According to Dr. Tobacman, the native carrageenan, after being subjected to stomach acids may be broken down into the degraded form and be a cancer risk. And even if it wasn't, carrageenan cannot be identified as native or degraded on food labels, so there is no way of knowing if you are ingesting carrageenan, the carcinogen or not."

I have also tasted the plain coconut water, and the only good thing about that is that it is a base to add with something else.  The only combination that works and is tolerable to drink is the coconut and pineapple combo.  And even after a couple of those, you don't really enjoy it.

294319,B0085MLY5A,A15CCFQPU1N7U8,chick_tabu,12,22,2,1312329600,According to CNN's report on VitaCoCo....,"(update)According to an article on CNN.com on 8/5/11, the nutritional content of this brand does not live up to what is on the label.<br />""Researchers at ConsumerLab.com tested the sodium, potassium, magnesium, and sugar content of three leading brands of coconut water, and they found that only one, Zico Natural, contained the stated amount for all four ingredients.<br /><br />The sugar and potassium content in the other two brands, Vita Coco and O.N.E., almost matched the label. But the amounts of sodium and magnesium--two nutrients key to hydration--were as much as 82% and 35% lower, respectively, than the listed amount.""<br /><br />I ordered two to try out from Amazon but while waiting on the delivery, I was out shopping when I observed a lot of companies were suddenly cashing out on coconut milk/water! I bought one brand-name from Lucky's Super Market and another brand from Walgreen's next door. Being of Polynesian heritage and homegrown from the islands but living on the mainland, I thought, ""Hmmm..all these centuries coconuts been around, suddenly its being pitched as nutritional & interesting. Let's see what the catch is"". Both were almost $3.00 but only a particular brand I bought at Lucky's taste like REAL COCONUT MILK 'WATER/Milk' right out the coconut. In Asia, coconut milk comes from ""soaking the flesh of the older coconut"". But I'm not from Asia which is why I call it coconut milk & not coconut water right of the coconut.<br /><br /> Finally, VitaCoCo came. I tasted it and spit it right out. It didnt taste like coconut water to our family 'at all'. Then I looked to see where it was produced. Before I go further let me explain something to those who may not know. Agriculture for fruits are always better on tropical islands, or from the Caribbean islands. You won't find any fruits more richer in juice or sweeter anywhere else in the world. Vita CoCo says it is produced by a company in Latin America, Brazil. Produced for All Markets Inc. New York, NY. My sister then poured some into a glass and screamed, ""OMG They're ripping people off! It's watered down!"" She said that because pure coconut milk has a milky color to it. Some less, some more but never crystal clear. The younger the fruit, the richer, more nutritional, and milky the coconut milk. The more mature the fruit, the sweeter & thinner the milk. As the fruit ripens the coconut water gets converted into the solid meat of the fruit. The meat then becomes more nutritional then the milk. So I told her that they weren't ripping consumers off because it says, 100% pure coconut WATER. It's either a little coconut milk diluted with a lot of pure water, or this is what Brazilian coconuts taste like (flat)? And it seems like they're using 'over-riped' coconuts. Which makes sense. Then the meat of the coconut could be sold and not tossed out.<br /><br />As for those who have to have potassium every night like my aunt, DO NOT rely on Vita Coco's ad. My aunt finished off the 17 fl oz of Vita CoCo and still woke up with painful side effects from taking prednisone. This is also how we knew Vita CoCo must be using over-ripe less nutritional coconuts, or watering it down. I ended up having to prepare the daily one banana she's suppose to have before bedtime. Drink mango or guava juice all! The most nutritional of all island fruits ;)"

Our favorites were the mango and passion fruit, which were delicious.  Then the tetrapacks disappeared from the local grocery store, and a few weeks later this new Zico showed up in plastic bottles with new ""Lima Citron"" and ""Pomberry"" flavor.<br /><br />I bought a few, hoping they would match up to the old flavors.  But, alas, they do not.  In fact, the Lima Citron  and Pomberry flavors are downright disgusting.<br /><br />My fiance had the Pomberry flavor.  He had the flu and wanted to rehydrate (which coconut water is excellent for).  His sense of taste was not in full capacity because he was sick, but he commented to me that it just tasted wrong, and he wasn't sure if it was because he was sick or if it was the drink itself.  I tried it myself, and sure enough it was the drink.  It's gross.<br /><br />Then I tried the Lima Citron flavor.  I took a few sips, thinking maybe it would grow on me, and it did not.  I threw away most of it.  The flavor is like a mixture of pure lime juice and alum -- extremely bitter, sour, and astringent, as if the manufacture put in extra tannins.  It reminded me of the time I bought an unripened persimmon from the Asian grocer, and after biting into it felt my mouth go instantly dry and pucker up.  Don't get me wrong -- I can tolerate sour things.  I can eat an entire lemon or lime and enjoy it.  But this was unbearable.<br /><br />The only palatable flavor is the ""Natural"" flavor, which is just coconut water.  The other two -- nasty, NaStY, NASTY!<br /><br />Buy VitaCoco instead."

The fact of the matter is that I have been drinking coconut water for over a year now, from Vita Coco, O.N.E., Zico (original), Zico (new Coca Cola disaster) and the bottom line is that the NEW ZICO IS DISGUSTING. It's 1) from concentrate (not pure 100% coconut water), 2) tastes really bad cold and 3) tastes even worse at room temperature.<br /><br />Coca Cola, in typical American corporate greed, took what was the BEST coconut water (Zico original, Mango and Passion Fruit) and absolutely and blatantly destroyed it. They really did. It's absolutely horrid and disgusting and probably not as good for you due to it being from concentrate. Should I mention that it's also more EXPENSIVE than before?<br /><br />Good job Coca Cola, glad to see you have taken over a great product and destroyed it to increase your stock price.<br /><br />O.N.E. is currently the best 100% natural coconut water, in plain flavor.

The taste of it brought me back to the lunch time in Finland.<br /><br />I recommend Leksands' crispbreads, not only because of my sentimental value, buy because they taste good (I love how I can keep getting flavor as I keep munching).<br /><br />I wake up 5am in the morning, and then work for couple of hours before breakfast. By then, I usually get very hungry and tend to have cravings for a big breakfast (e.g., eggs, sausage and bacon...) But I know I'd end up with heavy stomach and regret having it afterward.<br /><br />I had Leksands crispbread the other morning (when I was very hungry as usual) as breakfast and I was full after 3 pieces of crispbread (=120 calorie compared to infinite if I had eaten the traditional English style breakfast). Much less calorie intake, with higher amount of fiber, and My body felt light as I ate before but just felt satisfied as I was not hungry.<br /><br />While it MAY take some adjustments for people who are used to eat muffins, pastries or heavier food for breakfast, you will be surprised that you can put pretty much anything on it and, while it'd taste good, you can still get a good amount of fibers from each piece.<br /><br />You can just eat the crispbread as it is with a cup of tea, coffee, a glass of juice or even with water [you want to have liquid nearby as crispbreads are dry :-)]. If it still feels/tastes too dry for you, put a little butter on it (that's how I used to eat in Finland). Crispbread goes very well with marinated herring.<br /><br />As other reviewer mentioned, I also wish I could buy in smaller quantities from Amazon.<br />However, buying this in bulk from Amazon definitely saves money, and they keep well for long periods of time, as long as you keep in a dark, dry place.<br /><br />I recommend Leksands Crispbread for anyone who wants to lead a healthier life style.<br /><br />++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br /><br />Leksands Crispbread<br /><br />Ingredients: Whole rye flower, yeast, water, salt<br /><br />Nutrition Facts<br /><br />Serving size:  1 piece (12.5g/0.4oz)<br />Serving per container:  16<br />Calories:  40 (per piece)<br />Total Fat:  0%<br />Cholesterol:  0mg<br />Sodium:  60mg (2% of Daily Value)<br />Total Carbohydrate:  8g (3% of Daily Value)<br />  Dietary fiber:  2g (8% of Daily Value)<br />  Sugars:  0g<br />Protein:  1g<br /><br />Vitamin A:  0%<br />Vitamin C:  0%<br />Calcium:  0%<br />Iron:  2%<br /><br />[*Percent Daily Values are based n a 2000 calorie diet.

Buying in bulk shipment from Amazon means that the price I pay for a pound of coffee drops from almost $7 to under $5 -- well worth it. People accustomed to the bitter, burnt taste of Starbucks coffee won't like Community Coffee -- it's a traditional American grind that makes what some would consider ""weak"" coffee, but it's what I prefer.<br /><br />EDIT: Well, the price of coffee keeps going up. From around $47 per 10 lb box to more than $63. So it's less of a great deal now, but still cheaper than buying it in the grocery store."

The 12oz was still available, but I don't think the 12oz package is worth the money. I wrote a letter to Community asking why the 1LB gone and apparently too many people found this package too difficult to deal with. I learned I could buy the 1LB packages on-line direct from CC, for essentially the same price as the grocery store, but then I saw it's even less at Amazon... And you can save even more by setting up a subscription. Well count me in and I'm a happy Community Coffee drinker.<br /><br />PS. I find if I use about 3/4 the recommended amount of ground coffee and the coffee comes out fine. I always think we are told to use more than is really needed, so I experimented with less coffee for the same taste. 3/4s seems to work fine for us and our coffee maker (of course your mileage may vary).<br /><br />Oh, one other note... I've order 10LBs (10 one-pound bags) twice now, and each time one bag's vacuum seal was broken. No big deal as I just use this bag first, but it is an odd coincidence.<br /><br />UPDATE 10/26/2012 - I've now purchased this package 4 times. Each time there is at least one package without the vacuum, however on this last order 3 bags did not have the vacuum seal. It's still a good deal, especially with the subscription discount."

It has been said in certain circles that as a quid pro quo for endorsing a product, the manufacturer provides your beloved Seer with generous monetary kickbacks. Nothing could be further from the truth. Yes, I know that I gave into weakness many reviews ago and was supposed to get a kickback from that deodorant manufacturer. But the check bounced and some new Federal law went into effect preventing me from blatant profiteering. Well. at least my underarms don't offend anyone.<br /><br />As most of you know, by reading my online bio, I need to jump start my day with a few cups of coffee. The jumping cables are hooked up straight from the coffee cup to my ears (the left ear is the negative side) and I get that special ""buzz"" that allows me to write my ever-evolving reviews and lectures.<br /><br />But as I travel throughout the world, many heads of state ask me ""would you like sugar with that good, kind, generous, selfless Metamorpho"". I tell them no. Why? Because I have found a sugar subsitute that works better for me. Yes. It's equal!<br />I trained most countries to have it ready when I arrive (although Cuba and Venzuela have refused thus far). Anyway, equal comes in these nifty little packets that are easy to rip open and pour. Each one is ""equal"" to about a teaspoon of regular sugar (or so my tastebuds have surmised). I have been using it for years and have had no after effects. In fact, it has been instrumental in the growth of my third eye. All apprentice seers should know this.<br /><br />There is no bitter aftertaste either. I really hate it when I'm in a restaurant and have to settle for sweet n low. I tell ya people, it ruins the whole dining experience. One word of caution for all you aspiring Betty Crockers out there. Do not, I repeat, do not try to bake with equal. It does not do well being heated. Unless you want that gingerbread man to taste like flatbread, I would avoid using it.<br /><br />Equal works very well with all flavoured coffees and tea.

I use this in tea, coffee, baking, frying, etc. I made triple chocolate brownies and used it instead of vegetable oil and they were fabulous. I make the best popcorn using white popcorn, coconut oil, salt, and a couple of pinches of sugar. I love the health benefits of using coconut oil. I also make a body scrub using it and sugar and essence of orange. I wash my face in it and people always ask if it causes breakouts. No, it doesn't. The sugar exfoliates my skin and the coconut oil leaves it silky smooth. I shave my legs with it. I'm going to make body scrub gifts for Christmas. This stuff is awesome."

Frustrating to use.  I will continue to purchase, and continue to complain.<br /><br />The product is produced in India, where ambient temperatures maintain the oil in constant liquid state.  In more northerly climes, such as my own in (U.S.) WA state, the oil is always congealed to semisolid condition, making the silly little container cap useless.  ""Thawing"" of a quart container is clumsy, yet managing a handful of smaller containers is an unnecessary circus of busywork.  For export to cooler destinations, the product should be packaged in a wide-mouth container permissive of product extraction via spoon or spatula."

Same as fingernails or animal horns, as all hair is dead on a cellular level -- unromantic but true.<br /><br />I have ""thirsty"" (those quotes, again!) hair, and conditioner doesn't always seem to help much.  I also have skin sensitivities, so after one manufacturer changed a formula on one of my faves for the worse, I decided to try coconut oil.<br /><br />The results are dramatic.  My hair looks really nice, as shiny as it was in my 20s, it's soft again, and I'm feeling kind of like a dupe that I've been buying chemically formulated conditioner all these years.  I agree with other reviewers that this oil, or at least the batch I got, seems to have something in it to keep it from solidifying (at least in a 70something degree bathroom) the way most culinary coconut oils will. It also doesn't have the same rich coconut flavor of my favorite brands, such as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E1MI"">Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 29-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)</a> - but then it's filtered, and not extra-virgin.  Probably for the best, because as nice as coconut is, I really don't want to go around smelling like cheap suntan lotion!<br /><br />Disclaimer:  using too much will obviously wreck greasy havoc on some hair, especially finer, lighter, european hair -- which I have, actually.  I couldn't have used this at all back in the day when my hair was naturally on the oily side, but if you have coarse, frizzy, wiry, or even just really dry hair, you can probably find the right amount for you to bring back the nice texture and shine without getting overly heavy -- even if that means mixing it in with a bit of gentle shampoo."

The key to using this sauce is MODERATION! If you use too much you will be begging for mercy. But when you get it right, it puts just the right amount of heat to get your scalp tingling but not so bad that it takes away from the taste of what your cooking. This is excellent when mixed with chili or your favorite BBQ sauce. Look, anyone can make something hot but if it's so hot you can't taste the food then whats the purpose? This sauce allows you to add heat to your dish and still allows you to taste your dish as long as you learn to add a drop at a time until you find your tolerence level. REMEMBER your tolerence level is not the same as everyone else's! One of the great things about this sauce is you have to use so little that a single bottle will last a long time!<br /><br />Well worth the price and highly recommended. However, one word of CAUTION as with any hot sauce, when you handle or cook with this sauce be sure to wash your hands thoroughly afterwards. When adding this sauce while cooking, the vapors will contain this sauce and get on your hands. Even hours after cooking, if you don't wash your hands and you happen to rub your eyes, you will regret it!<br /><br />The best thing to me about this sauce is it can be added during cooking or afterwards. Either way though, you have to remember to use it in moderation and treat it like a loaded weapon! It really is a great sauce in my opinion!"

Several drops of this in a pot of soup or chili produces amazing results.<br /><br />What you likely don't want to do is to try a dime size serving of this on a cracker like my 22 year old son did.  He had been bragging about his pepper tolerance, so he had to try it.  After first eating it, he blurted out, ""see, this isn't that hot"".

This was the only one that I was displeased with.  First off the sauce is just too hot.  I know what you are going to say...  but the truth is I love hot sauce, and have only come across one or two that are just too hot to enjoy.  This is so far beyond hot that I feel it's abusive.  It was so strong that my lips were red and swollen for several hours.  That was only from an amount the size of the head of a pin.<br /><br />All that said, it would still be worth cooking with it, if it had a good flavor, but it doesn't.  The initial flavor, before the heat kicks in, is nothing more than molasses. This gives it an unpleasant cloying taste that does not go well with the off the charts fire.<br /><br />If you need something for self defense, this would make a good choice.

Many of them are very cardboardy - they try their best, but they sacrifice a lot of flavor in order to keep the junk stuff out. I'm really pleased that in modern times they seem to have figured out the balance of ingredients to make this work!<br /><br />First, this chip set is fully organic, including certification. The ingredient list is rather clear. Corn. Soy grits. Flaxseed. Corn oil, sea salt, water, lime. You know exactly what is in here! There's no wheat, no gluten. No cholesterol.<br /><br />Ah, but how does it taste? If it's like cardboard, it doesn't matter how good it is for you - you're not going to eat it. Luckily, it is rather good! I am *especially* impressed how it tastes nice and salty, but each serving only has 50mg of salt - i.e only 2% of your daily salt intake!! This is incredibly low for a chip or snack food.<br /><br />For other stats, there is 13g of carbs, minus the 4g of fiber leaves 9g of net carbs. There are 8g of fat (1g is saturated) and 140 calories. This is for about 7 large chips.<br /><br />These chips have 6% iron, 2% Vitamin A and 2% calcium. So the serving is not going to give you enough to really worry about skipping your multivitamins, but heck, it's a nice bonus.<br /><br />Now, I don't recommend sitting down and eating your way through an entire bag of these at one sitting :) The whole bag would still give you 90g of carbs, or 1400 calories. That's not a healthy way to get your energy! But there are many times that you want a snack and want something crunchy. Fiber is of course VERY good for you, too. If you have some healthy salsa, it's a good way to get some good veggies into you on a chip base that has very little salt, has good ingredients and is tasty."

This chemical has been banned in Europe and the food and drug administration has even banned it in the form of vitamins in America.  In lab rats, poor things, it has caused internal bleeding and lesions on their heart, liver and kidneys among other internal organs.

The fish itself is very good sockeye with a nice red color and firm flesh.  However, the smoke on this fish is so delicate it nears bland.  The smokey flavor is there but you have to strain to taste it.  What is unfortunate about this fact is that sockeye should have a rich distinct flavor.  Instead, the smoke robs the flesh of its richness and doesn't really give you much in return.  The net result is something nearer salmon jerkey rather than smoked sockeye.  The overall effect is OK, but my initial reaction was ""what have they done to this fish!""<br /><br />Edit:  Sockeye has a high fat content and as a consequnce you should avoid if on a diet."

(To ease the puppy into a new diet, he suggested I start by mixing 1/4 cup new food with 3/4 old food for a few days, then half and half, etc).  He also recommended that I mix in a couple of tablespoons of canned food with some water, just to make the dry food moist.

I did my research online and almost every site had favorable reviews for this product.  Reading some of the other reviews for other brands (*cough, Vogue, **) I found them suspicious (always need to be careful with reviews, since companies hire people to write positive reviews).  I was torn between buying this product or Rapunzel... I was not familiar with this brand, but was familiar with Rapunzel because I bought it in the past at a local Whole Foods and thought it was adequate but did not like the fact that the cubes contained so much palm oil (took forever for a cube to dissolve into boiling water).  I am in no means a crunchy granola vegan and think that I am pretty discerning when it comes to taste.<br /><br />I followed the directions of this product and dissolved 1 teaspoon into 1 cup boiling water.<br />*Pros* The result was a fine tasting broth... some of the yeast extract did not fully dissolve into the solution (I stirred quite a bit) but the broth was good nonetheless... surprisingly, the broth was not as salty as I thought...<br />Additionally, you can see all the bits and pieces of the herbs that this product contains.<br />*Cons* The container is a bit flimsy - it was hard to pull off the inner aluminum foil.  If not careful you will have vegetable powder all over yourself.  This may be trivial, but the packaging is very outdated.  It's 2012 and the company can surely hire a graphic designer that can produce better packaging design than what they have now...<br /><br />While I was researching, it seemed as though a fair amount of people make their own vegan vegetable powder.  Almost all recipes use nutritional yeast as its base, but differ on the rest of the ingredients (for instance, once used powder versions of many ingredients, while another recipe basically took whole vegetables chopped up, cubed, and dehydrated and food processed into powder form).<br /><br />I prefer powder broth over cubes - it's a lot more convenient, and you have better control and adjust the strength of your broth.  With this said, the broth does in some way feel like it is missing something...  I might purchase the Rapunzel powder to see how good that product is.  I predict that I might get tired of this broth (considering Amazon sells it to you in a pack of 6) it isn't a bad idea to have a back-up brand to change up the flavor.  The Rapunzel powder however has more salt, and seems to have less vegetable ingredients (I like the fact that this brand has a lot of vegetable ingredients, and some that are not common in the U.S., like lovage).  What Rapunzel has going for it is that it is organic, while this is just ""all natural"" (which is fine).<br /><br />Buy all your vegan broth products on Amazon - you will get an amazing price.  I can't find any of these products at a normal supermarket, and Whole Foods charges an arm and a leg for these things.  Even with many new Trader Joe's that just opened up in NYC giving Whole Foods competition and a run for its money, TJ just doesn't have the wide variety of niche products that Whole Foods has.<br /><br />Update**:  This product tastes BETTER than the Rapunzel vegetable broth powder (I have both).  Using the recommended directions for both products, Seitenbacher has a deeper, more complex flavor whereas Rapunzel's tastes very salty (salt is the #1 ingredient in Rapunzel).  If you want flavor, go for Seitenbacher - if you are obsessed about everything being organic, then go for Rapunzel."

Then I tried Orgain.  YUM.  I am no having one of these and one Blueberry or Mango Mix 1 Protein shake per day and actually meeting my protein requirements each day.  My nails and hair are finally looking better and I'm actually starting to have more energy.  I'm so glad Amazon carries these, as my Whole Foods tends to run out of these.  I do however wish that they would put them on automatic subscription, as they have with the Mix 1 shakes.<br /><br />It's great that it's still whey protein, I've definitely never found a whey shake that tastes this good, only the soy ones, which don't have the best absorption.<br /><br />Also, it's great that you can travel with these shakes and not have to refrigerate them or mix them, as they are ready to drink.  I'll just get a cup of ice while traveling or at the office and I'm good to go!  You can even add supplement powder to it if needed, and it dissolves well in it. I actually recommend this flavor over the fudge one, and I'm a chocolate nut.  The fudge just was a little too cocoa-ey for my taste.  The vanilla is pretty sweet, which I like.  I think it might be yummy with some Starbucks Via added in it for an iced latte too.<br /><br />UPDATE 8/20/2011<br />I saw where another review stated that they had received curdled milk!  I did too.  Amazon sent 2 new cases immediately, but unfortunately both of them were curdled as well.  I had ordered the mocha from another online retailer at the same time and it arrived without incident.  I'm not sure why 4 cases arrived curdled, but it was pretty gross when I got lumpy milk instead of my usually amazing Orgain breakfast.  I wanted to do the subscribe and save, but cancelled it, until someone makes sure they know why it was curdled and can ensure it won't arrive in that condition."

Among other things, it no longer contains soy, which I think is a good thing since it can be an allergen and can cause digestive discomfort (gas, bloating, in some cases).<br /><br />Unfortunately, with this change, apparently some bad batches made it out into the market (mine were dated 8/21 and 8/22). These batches have a weird and very strong ""grassy"" flavor that is indeed quite disgusting (which I think I've tasted before from some organic milk from grass fed cows).<br /><br />However, if you receive these batches, please try contacting them with your concerns before jumping to conclusions. I sent them a private message on Facebook ([...]) with the codes on top of my drinks, and they quickly responded, sending me free replacement cases.<br /><br />The replacements tasted just like the formula before the change (as far as I could tell).<br /><br />They know there's a problem, and are working to resolve it.

I really wanted to like this product and commit to it -- so I ordered a case of the creamy chocolate fudge shakes.

Robard shakes are delicious and filling, but have a lot of unhealthy ingredients and are expensive, plus not readily accessible. When I found Orgain, I thought it'd be a great alternative because it's organic. However, if you're lactose-intolerant, beware -- it contains milk. And a very strange mediciney taste. I'm stuck with a case of this stuff -- maybe if I blend it with bananas it'll be palatable. Buy a couple of the single servings, if you can find them, before committing to a large order."

I did some research and found that ORGAIN met my requirements.  I've been drinking it for about two months now, at least one a day.  Not only do they taste good, but they have helped me gain back a lot of the muscle mass that I lost during my hospital stay (almost two weeks).  The only draw back to the product is the cost.

I used this as a meal replacement and was very impressed on how well it sat on my very sensitive stomach. I don't care for the soy protein factor or even the whey, since it would appeal more without these ingredients.

I've tried both available flavors of Orgain and I find the chocolate to have no remnant of soy protein in its taste.  The shake tastes great at room temp and amazing chilled.  I appreciate that there's some remnants of veggies and fruit in the shake too.<br /><br />Potential downsides:<br />It's not all oil, sugar, and protein....although its mostly that...  So it's not exactly as good as sitting down and eating a sandwich.  The shake is only made in pre-measured little boxes so there's no opportunity to save some money with a tub of a dry mix.  The shakes are expensive too.  The trade off is better ingredients, instead of unpronounceable and artificial junk found in say, Slimfast (although that too is mostly oil, sugar, and protein...just from worse ingredient sources).  The shake is also not vegan if that's something you're looking for.  There's currently only 2 flavors of the shake too, so if variety's your thing, this isn't a good shake to try out long term.<br /><br />I still rate this 5 stars for the ingredients, the taste, and the fairly extensive nutrition content.  I wish this had more veggies and fruit in it though...vs. 50 mg each of a fruit and veggie blend."

I'm not sure what exactly Orgain has done to make this taste so great, but with organic ingredients, I'm not sure I care.  I 100% recommend this to anyone - even if you're skeptical of protein drinks.  Haven't yet tried the vanilla or mocha, but looking forward to doing so."

(I also LOVE that they aren't in plastic bottles). There are a gajillion other things I could say, but really you just need to read the nutrition info for yourself. I bought these to drink for breakfast since I am rarely hungry enough to eat actual food in the mornings and I was pleasantly surprised by how GOOD they taste (Very fudgey.) I am now somewhat obsessed with these and find myself craving them when I'm not in the mood for a big meal, or when I'm sick and I don't want solid foods. They keep me full for at least 2 hours, not as much as a real meal, but plenty for breakfast. I can't seem to find these in stock at any nearby stores, which is fine since you automatically get super saver shipping on these, but beware that the price will skyrocket when they're backordered (these things are like liquid gold). I can't start my morning without these anymore and insist on dragging them with me on vacations and trips. Beware the vanilla flavor though, which I hated so much that I threw them away (no one would take them off my hands). They were lumpy and left a gross after taste. I haven't tried the mocha flavor since I'm not into coffee, but it sounds like it would be good if you are a coffee drinker! I hope they come up with some other flavors to try!"

I would like to shake the hand of the developer for making a healthy drink for an affordable price. I've heard enough educated people warn about the other RTD drinks like muscle milk (which I used to drink for a lack of alternatives) that I figured I better find something a with higher quality ingredients even if I end up spending a little bit more. Well Orgain is very reasonably priced and isn't filled with garbage preservatives and msg derivatives. I went through 2 12 packs and am sold since the taste has remained delicious throughout (sometimes you initially like something but eventually get olfactory & taste exhaustion). IMO Orgain hit a home run with this RTD mix.<br /><br />About the only thing I wish Orgain would change is to offer a mix without the added vitamin mix. I like the veggie blend, fruit blend, and anti-oxident blend that is included, but since I already take other high-quality supplements I don't think the vitamin blend is necessary even if it is in relatively low-amounts.

She was right!  I love these things.  I have only briefly read up on her claims, but from what I can tell, it's all true.<br /><br />The only cons I have found to this product is 1)Cost.  They are pretty expensive to use on a regular basis.  2) The serving is 255 calories and it doesn't quite keep me satisfied as a ""meal"" but has too many calories to consider it a snack. I'm not too fond of the vanilla.  It's got a good flavor, but the few times I've had it, I've gotten ""clumps"" at the bottom of the container.  That grosses me out.  Never happened with the Mocha or Chocolate flavors though.  The chocolate is my favorite but the mocha is good too.

The chocolate was okay, but the vanilla bean had a strange after-taste....still not sure how to describe it - reminded me of cornbread and soybeans.  Adding frozen fruit and blending it helped a little, but didn't completely mask the weird after-taste.  Maybe it was a 'bad batch,' but the expiration date was March 2012, so I don't believe that was the probem.

He's not much into chocolate-milk type things. I got the case today, chilled a few, and tasted it.<br /><br />There's that weird aspect to the taste--first kinda like bacon, then sorta green. It's really unpleasant in the first sip. Fortunately, after a few more sips, you start to get used to it and can get the vanilla vibe better. I'm assuming it's the veggie component in there making me cringe at first--since I don't normally have veggie smoothies masquerading as vanilla shakes. I like my veggie smoothies overtly, unapologetically veggie-green. I like the taste of the Green Magma or Green Goddess type smoothies  that have spinach, celery, cucumber, parsley, etc. :) (Don't know why my first sip of Orgain hollered, ""bacon!"" at me, but there it is. Offputting.)<br /><br />The shake is thin--watery even. NOT creamy or thick.<br /><br />I could drink this if I needed unto. I've had some protein shakes that made me gag. This did not, it went down easily, no weird slimy texture, no weird chalkiness, just that odd smoky/then/green vibe. It's not something I could say was tasty.<br /><br />Maybe the chocolate flavor hides that weird taste thing going on better than the vanilla. I like the Amazing Grass that has the cocoa, so I could see that working. Still,  I doubt I'll order it to find out. I hope hubby likes this flavor. I don't really want to finish this case."

I don't normally like to leave negative reviews of anything, but I feel it's my duty to express my difference of opinion.  I have tried only the ""chocolate"", and I use quotation marks because it tastes like no chocolate I have ever tasted in my entire life, and I'm a girl who knows her way around chocolate.  It was absolutely the most disgusting protein drink I have ever tasted.  If you put bark mulch, lawn clippings and a little bit of manure in a blender with milk and drank it - that might be a close comparison to the taste of this stuff, in my humble opinion.  I can't even believe I spent money on these, or that anyone else does.  Maybe if you're one of those people who drinks wheatgrass or eats carob like it's really chocolate, or one of those other ""healthy"" and a way too earthy concoctions, you'll like it.

I ordered a case from Amazon, and chilled them... even better, IMO.  Now, not only do I feel healthier, less hungry, and have more energy, but I also broke through the pound plateau and have lost weight since I started drinking Orgain.  I've recommended it to family members, and I continue to drink it myself.  I'm so glad I took an uncharacteristic risk and tried it."

I recently had 2 surgeries, and was looking forward to using orgain to get better. Had I known they were going to completely botch the formula, I would've ordered 10 cases beforehand.<br /><br />But I order 3 cases a month ago... and they were so undrinkable i assumed we got a bad batch of spoiled ones. But there were 3 separate cases like this... with the individual drinks inside tasting 'spoiled'. The expiration date seemed okay.<br /><br />Well, now its clear that the product wasn't spoiled... the formula was spoiled.<br /><br />I'm just so, so disappointed. Orgain had become a major supplement towards my health and recovery process after an injury I sustained last year and was hoping it would continue to be so during my recovery phase after the surgery.<br /><br />That's the type of mindset this drink was created for, right? A doctor made it because he knew the need for healthy, essential amino acids, antioxidants, minerals, and organic blends to help someone gain weight, especially if they're been sick? A formula he concocted after beating cancer? Why not stick that??<br /><br />Am very disappointed to see this cheap change destroy the product that the brand was about.<br />Why should anyone prefer this over any other pre-made drink other than its hypoallergenic aspects? Many of the younger, healthier guys who're drinking this because it was simply better for you ounce for ounce than other mixes... well, good luck keeping them now. Especially with the huge change in taste. Just... augh. You can't even get it down.<br /><br />Am very sad to see such an amazing product be gutted without warning to its loyal consumers. If there really is a Doctor out there in charge of this company... well, I hope you still have a say in it, that you're reading these reviews, and hopefully that you'll evaluate your altered product for yourself and decide whether or not its something you would've preferred to the old orgain when you were recovering and rebuilding healthy mass. I imagine you would say - ""no"" - the old orgain was far more beneficial.<br /><br />I'm now looking for a new supplement shake. Very sad to see the old Orgain go.<br /><br />Anyone have any suggestions for other similar brands?"

It leaves a chalky aftertaste and just does not taste as good as the original.  As someone who does not have cancer, I also liked that I was getting additional anti-oxidants in the original formula.

I've given this a test trial for a week and noticed dramatic results.  I recover faster, easier, and I'm energized after the fact.  I sleep better at night too.  I missed dinner the day that Disneyland was open for 24 hours for Leap Day and took one of these along.  I felt great the whole night, only had three hours of sleep, and absolutely no fatigue when I went to work plus no ill-effects the following day.<br /><br />My boyfriend would scrunch up his face seeing me drink these.  He also is now a supporter of the product by caving into one of these yesterday night.  He came back home after playing a 1 1/2 hour match of ping pong, was really sleepy and tired, but wanted to go back out to play badminton.  He drank one of these and about 20 minutes later, felt good enough to go play badminton.  He said it felt like he was never tired initially and was still feeling good after playing for an hour.<br /><br />Instead of reaching for a Red Bull, soda, coffee, or something else with a ton of caffeine for a boost, drink this.

They're convenient on the go and I feel good about the ingredient list.  I prefer the chocolate but actually found the vanilla very pleasant as well, almost like melted vanilla ice cream or rich vanilla soymilk.  The chocolate is a bit chalky, but more in a cocoa powder sort of way, so not bad.<br /><br />As someone who doesn't eat much meat or dairy, these are a great alternative for me once in a while.  I was nearly living off of them for several weeks last summer, and feeling reasonably good while doing so, but then sort of went cold turkey.  The bottom line is that real, whole foods are always going to be better for you but if that isn't an option, these are a better alternative than junk food or nothing.  I still have a case and a half left and will probably consume them here and there, sparingly.  I do recommend them, especially in place of typical protein supplements."

I immediately noticed the flavor change that other reviews have mentioned (I always ordered the chocolate flavor) and agree the new ingredient flavor change was NOT for the better. I was very disappointed.<br /><br />Then I suddenly realized that Orgain was no longer available at ALL in my local Whole Foods where I used to find it in both the shelf and chilled sections of the store. I then noticed that my 'subscribe & save' case shipping from Amazon quit shipping entirely after a years on-going subscription. I mentioned this to the friend who first introduced me to Orgain only to hear her tell me that our very popular and local vegetarian grocery store, Rainbow Grocery, has also quit selling it. I assumed that Orgain went out of business but I am still finding it online here at Amazon (just no longer with subscribe & save option) - and the official website appears to be up and running (with Whole Foods still quite confusingly being listed as a retail provider). I checked another Whole Foods retail store in another city and they, too, have quit selling this product which leads me to believe that Whole Foods has backed out entirely.<br /><br />Super frustrated and really disappointed on all counts.

It was my breakfast every morning as well as my husbands. We loved Orgain so much that we had several cases auto shipped to us every month. Then a couple months ago, we thought we got a bad batch of the iced mocha and so we returned them and tried getting them locally in a store by us. Same horrific taste. At the same time, we were dropped from the auto ship program and it was getting harder to find it in the local stores in that flavor so we assumed they changed the formula but the Vitamin Shoppe had no idea and there was no indication on the packaging saying that there were any changes made. So, we tried switching to the chocolate fudge. It was delicious so we just changed our auto ship to the new flavor and for a couple months got by with the chocolate fudge. Then, we got dropped from the auto ship again and had a harder time finding it in the stores. Apparently, they changed the chocolate fudge formula also. I just got 2 new cases and they have that same DISGUSTING taste that the iced mocha had. Needless to say we can't drink it anymore, will be returning what we have and actively trying to find a replacement drink. I can't tell you how disappointed we are. All I can say is that unless they change the formula back, I'll never buy it again. It isn't even drinkable. It's absolutely revolting!"

In my area, the Whole Foods by me sells out often and generally only has the Vanilla Bean flavor in stock (my least favorite). The local health food store, hardly ever has them as well. So, I was quite happy after finding the Orgain shakes on Amazon, over a year ago.<br /><br />Nutrition wise, I can honestly say that there is definitely an increase in energy after consistently drinking these, but not in that unnatural, over stimulated way that caffeinated or chemical laden products can sometimes leave you feeling. I use them as meal replacements when pressed for time, when my appetite is light, and/or an hour before working out...for the energy boost.<br /><br />Cost wise, if you're on a tight budget, this product might be a bit of a splurge, but is still less per shake, than the average latte, or fast food meal. Which is obviously, not as healthy for you.<br /><br />Currently, I switch between drinking the Cafe Mocha and Chocolate Fudge and would highly recommend this product. For those like myself, who work in an office setting, these are a great option to keep in the work fridge, in order to steer clear of that office snacking area (the vending machine, that co-worker who loves to bake, the Friday doughnut day, etc.)."

294940,B005V9UG18,A1X52NCRAKJS0F,"Diane ""Healthy and Fit""",2,2,5,1325894400,Great Taste,"I saw this in a wellness email I get and checked out their website and was impressed. I was able to locate this at my local grocery store and tried the chocolate, vanilla and the coffee mocha. I only liked the chocolate the other two flavors were doable but I would not buy again but that is just me as I typically find that drinks with these flavors do not suit me. I really enjoy the chocolate and can drink it cold out of the carton without having to add/blend anything with it which makes it a great grab and go meal/snack. The price from Amazon is cheaper then the grocery store and the subscribe and save / auto delivery make it that much better. This will remain as a go to item in my pantry."
294941,B005V9UG18,A3EFSLEMHNPP6A,Senor Zoidbergo,2,2,5,1322438400,"FINALLY, Amazon offers Prime Shipping for the Mocha Flavor","I am a huge fan of Orgain; stumbled upon it a few months ago accidentally, when I was looking for an organic, high quality meal replacement/protein drink with no artificial sweeteners.  I don't like stevia either.  I love the ingredients list on Orgain- organic whey & milk proteins!!, brown rice syrup to avoid that sugar crash, and a great blend of vegetables and fruits.  I can't even tell from drinking that it contains kale, beet, spinach, carrots, and tomatoes.  The 16g of protein per asceptic container is perfect and ideally sized.<br /><br />I purchase at least 5-6 cases of Orgain a month, because I drink 2-3 a day.  At least 1 as a post-workout shake, and the others as meal supplements.  Orgain also helps me stay awake at night for evening classes, and are more preferable to consuming Red Bull or 5-hour energy drinks.  I credit Orgain (along with a healthy diet) for helping me lose weight and pursue my fitness goals.<br /><br />Big fan of the sweet vanilla and chocolate flavors, was hoping to try the Cafe Mocha flavor, but Amazon didn't offer any with Prime shipping...until now!  The coffee flavor is delicious; there's a slight coffee-ish aftertaste, but I like it.  Its flavor profile lies somewhere between the more neutral vanilla and the stronger chocolate flavors.  There's also no caffeine in the Mocha varieties.  Unlike the vanilla flavor, I'm happy to report that the Mocha flavors do not seem prone to  whey protein aggregation.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and grab a Cafe Mocha Orgain!  Pop it in the fridge, and it'll be like drinking a nice iced coffee from Starbucks, but much healthier.  Just a final caveat; the Cafe Mocha flavor seems very popular, and frequently goes out of stock.  Buy it when you can!"

I recently subscribed-and-saved so I get a shipment of the Vanilla Bean flavor monthly. I have delayed gastric emptying and the Orgain drinks are helpful on bad days. They are way better all around than the alternatives for meal replacement drinks. I recently had an unexpected quality issue with the most recent carton she received, so I contacted Orgain about the problem. They replied promptly, offered a replacement, and followed up thoroughly. The quality of customer service I received was great--you don't get that very often. The company really seems to care about putting a quality product out there and keeping their customers happy. Orgain: Keep up the good work. Amazon: Keep offering good deals on this awesome product. Everyone else: Try Orgain, you'll be glad you did."

I've been drinking protein shakes for over 10 years and have tried every single brand available. The powdered, the ready made, the big jugs, the protein water, etc. This tastes so good it should not be healthy! And on top of the great protein, there is nothing bad in it! Even my two boys love them. The chocolate is the best, in my opinion, but the vanilla and mocha are still better than anything out there. I travel all the time for work and now that I've discovered these great drinks, I have to figure out a way to get 5 of them in my checked luggage for every week that I'm gone from home!

Previously, I was mixing my own protein shakes (chocolate whey protein with unsweetened diluted coconut milk, and a banana blended) every morning for breakfast.  Since I found Orgain, I no longer have to clean my hand blender every day and waste five plastic cups a week or carry around a dirty cup until I get home from work.  The taste is amazing (the vanilla is decent, but not nearly as good as the chocolate) and the nutritional content and organic ingredients are exactly what I was looking for.  It's smooth and creamy (not gritty) and, don't worry, you only taste chocolate, not the vegetable extracts, vitamins and minerals (the vanilla tastes significantly more mineral-and-protein-powder-like, that's why I wouldn't recommend it).  I have a degree in nutrition, I am a semi-professional chef, I'm active, and I'm very picky with what I eat, so I'm impressed that I like a product like this so much.  Usually there's something I would want to change (like removing artificial sweeteners, sugar alcohols, etc).<br /><br />I live near Los Angeles and the only place I can find Orgain now is at Ralph's for $2.99/ea + tax and they do not offer any sort of discount for bulk purchases.  They used to carry it at Whole Foods for a month or two and would offer 10% off if you bought 10 or more, but they have recently stopped carrying it.  If you like this product as much as I do, the cheapest way to get it is to subscribe to have it regularly delivered through Amazon, giving you an additional 15% savings from the already low price and you will also receive free shipping!"

I've tried both available flavors of Orgain, and the Vanilla flavor I find to have some whey protein taste...I don't enjoy tasting whey protein but still find the drink palatable.  The shake tastes great at room temp and amazing chilled. I appreciate that there's some remnants of veggies and fruit in the shake too.<br /><br />Potential downsides:<br />It's not all oil, sugar, and protein....although its mostly that... So it's not exactly as good as sitting down and eating a sandwich. The shake is only made in pre-measured little boxes so there's no opportunity to save some money with a tub of a dry mix. The shakes are expensive too. The trade off is better ingredients, instead of unpronounceable and artificial junk found in say, Slimfast (although that too is mostly oil, sugar, and protein...just from worse ingredient sources). The shake is also not vegan if that's something you're looking for. There's currently only 2 flavors of the shake too, so if variety's your thing, this isn't a good shake to try out long term. I wish this had more veggies and fruit in it though...vs. 50 mg each of a fruit and veggie blend."

Most of all it sustains me for about 4 hours.  The taste is fantastic both chocolate and vanilla.  I feel healthy when I drink it.  I have been on weight watchers for 6 weeks now and with the help of Orgain I have lost 13 pounds and am nearing the 190's which I have not been in over 6 months.

Digests well, tastes amazing, very nutritious.<br /><br />My ONLY problem with this formulation is the use of Cane Sugar as the sweetener.

I can't stand most meal replacement shakes or protein shakes, because the texture usually seems off to me. When I have the time I use unflavored protein powder in a smoothie, but for days where that's just not possible Orgain has been an excellent substitute. I have tried chocolate and mocha, and both are great tasting. I prefer the mocha because I feel like I'm getting my coffee fix for the day--and though this stuff is caffiene free I feel energized without the jitters! It's a good breakfast, though occassionally I get an upset stomach after drinking it. I haven't been able to pinpoint why, but it's something to keep in mind if you have a sensitive stomach.<br /><br />I also drink orgain on my workout days, half a shake beforehand and the other half afterward.

For a high protein drink that is organic, whey-based, and contains the equivalent of 10 fruits & vegetables, this should be no big deal. I would describe the taste as a mildly sweet drink that has the body of 1% milk. It also contains solids that tend to pool near the bottom of the container (great looking packaging, BTW).

I contacted Orgain and they said the protein can become somewhat seperated. My wife and I ended up not liking the vanilla. So this is 5 stars on the chocolate fudge only. But Orgain had great customer service. Super fast response time and they said they would send me out a new pack of my flavor choice.

I thought that the brand name item would be better than the generic, so I bought a pack of six.  Honestly, the generic is better.  The cheese sauce in the Kraft is not as creamy, and it doesn't have as strong of a cheese taste.

When I grab a box of mac a cheese I want buttery, oily, creamy comfort food. When made right it can be a quick and delicious dinner.<br /><br />Let me tell you, every part of the process involving this ""deluxe"" version was disgusting.<br /><br />While squeezing the sickeningly dark orange cheese paste into the pot onto my cooked noodles, I could only wonder what the next step was to make this appetizing. Unfortunately there was none, you heat up the noodles, add the paste, and stir.<br /><br />It tasted even worse than it looked, very chemical, very chalky taste. For a second it reminded me of the terrible Mac and Cheese I used to get in elementary school, only to realize I was wishing for that over what I had on my spoon. I added some milk and butter in a desperate attempt to give the meal any semblance of edibleness, to no avail.<br /><br />I not only threw the rest out, I threw out the other two boxes I had bought. I hated it so much I made a point to write this review.<br /><br />...This is the only review I have ever written. Simply disgusting."

So I figured with the price incentive, this was an OK compromise. I'd tried it before, and it was fine. And I do love me some mac and cheese (even this lowfat version) in my weaker moments.<br /><br />Well, not this time. One of the boxes was kind of crushed in shipment and the macaroni was spilling out, so I thought ""what the hey, I'll just make it for dinner."" Ugh! Big mistake! Utterly disgusting. Unlike the reviewer who said the cheese sauce barely registered, I found it to be completely overpowering, and it had a horribly bitter chemical taste. I practically had to choke it down, and eventually I just gave up and threw it out. I have no idea if all the remaining 5 boxes will be just as bad, and I'm afraid to find out. I hope others who purchased this product at the same time will weigh in with their experiences.<br /><br />I'll definitely be sticking with Annie's.

This is all from the chia seeds you can see inside, which gives it a texture that is new and fun to drink.

Most of the time I don't even notice them. It's the seeds themselves that lock in their sugar and water until you ingest them, and then slowly release them for sustained endurance and hydration. They are loaded with fiber, calcium, protein, magnesium, and more.

One of my favorites.<br /><br />Note: I can't stand all these Starbuck's comparisons in Tassimo t-disc reviews. Starbuck's is clearly a cult, and it has trained its members to enjoy an over-roasted flavor, it has tricked them into thinking over-roasted is ""more flavorful,"" or something. It probably has more to do with economics, with their prevalence everywhere so they're an easy place to go, and henceforth they hook you. Plus, they ramp up the level of caffeine in their coffee, which is always good for feeding addictions.<br /><br />But do yourself a favor and look for a local coffee shop in your area that gets good reviews and try their espresso or even their macchiato (which, you may be surprised to find, is not simply a sweetened latte like Starbuck's makes them). Or even their regular coffee. Maybe slowly, but surely, you'll realize what coffee is supposed to be like.<br /><br />I go on this rant because a majority of reviews for Tassimo coffees consist of ""'almost as good as' or even, for those who appreciate good coffee, 'better than' the Starbucks Verona/House Blend/etc. Tassimo disc I can no longer get!"""

I favored them for high quality ingredients, excellent flavor, reasonable price, and wide availability. I find milk and soy products cause digestive distress, rice beverages have no such effect, no cholesterol, very little fat, and taste great. I prefer the vanilla flavors of all the rice beverage milk replacers. It's sweet, if you like that. The small packages are convenient to take along for lunch. The classic flavor is more milk-like than the vanilla or chocolate- but I love those flavors. Other rice beverage brands often don't have a chocolate.<br /><br />However, Imagine now uses the cheaper canola oil in their rice milk products. Canola oil contains erucic acid, a toxic chemical. The FDA has limited canola oil to no more than 2% erucic acid to protect our health, and do not allow it in infant formula. In addition, studies show the erucic acid it contains is toxic (see below). I have not been able to find any long term longitudinal controlled studies on humans to prove its safety as far as all the adversely affected organs.<br /><br />Good Karma Whole Grains Ricemilk is organic and also canola and sugar free. It has a thicker, richer and creamier body and flavor, less watered down. The vanilla flavor is a delicious drink, it tastes more like fresh whole milk straight out of the cow (if you have had that) than what is sold in cartons in the US. Westsoy Rice Beverage has similar consistency to Rice Dream, but is canola free. I find it to be less sweet, less chalky, and more milk-like in flavor.<br /><br />The same canola issue (as well as sugar) also applies to the Imagine frozen desert products.<br /><br />Because there have been Internet rumors about Canola that are based on misinformation, I provide some citations of scientific papers and government publications. Studies on erucic acid in rats and piglets show heart lesions, decreased red blood cell count, and other tissue and organ damage. Erucic acid crosses the blood-brain barrier and is known to affect nerve cells. It's not safe for infants. Check out this small sample of government and peer-reviewed medical journal articles documenting my statements, available online.<br /><br />United States Legislation on Low Erucic Acid Rapeseed Oil, Federal Department of Agriculture, 1985, article 184.1555, sections 3 and 4.<br />Growth Rate, Lipid Composition, Metabolism and Myocardial Lesions of Rats Fed Rapeseed Oils J.

I have the awful habit of using skin detox tea until my skin looks great, then not buying the tea for a while until I notice my skin becoming worse.<br />I have to say, that this tea has helped my skin quality in general mroe than any product that I have used. I have at times applied the tea topically as well for stronger effects, but it isn't neccessary for the tea to work. I've decided that i am going to actualyl keep myself in a constant supply of the tea, and drink it each day, as opposed to only after bad breakouts, to take a more proactive rather than reactive approach.<br /><br />Ad for the taste, I actually like it now. it took getting used to, but I find the taste calming and comforting now, as opposed to tolerable before.<br /><br />Anyway, if you have any hesitation whatsoever about tryig this tea for your skin, buy a box at the grocery store to try it out. I can almost guarantee that with regular use, though, your skin will improve.<br /><br />PRIOR REVIEW:<br />My first review, couldnt help myself!<br /><br />I heard some good things about this tea from a friend and decided that it couldnt hurt to order, as i am an avid tea-drinker anyway.<br /><br />Right before the tea arrived I began a horrendous breakout, the worst that I had had in years even. The entire left side of my face was covered in acne, perhaps a reaction from a new face-wash, that i since have been scared to touch!<br />Well a few days following the breakout the tea arrived. I figured there was no better situation really than this to try the tea so over the course of two weeks, besides general rinsing in the shower i have used no face wash, no creams or ointments, nothing. And my acne is almost gone!<br /><br />nothing new has popped up and everything that had been there is almost completely gone, i even notice acne scars fading if possible. my ance is literally drying up, as if i was using some sort of heavy cleanser or astringent, it is quite ridiculous. I am already looking at my budget to see if i have enough to order another batch.<br /><br />I used about 3 bags a day, one cup about midday with two tea bags, and one before bed with a single bag.<br /><br />The tea has a flavor that takes getting used to, both strong and weak at the same time, hard to explain. i don't use sugar so i don't know how it tastes with anything added.<br /><br />either way, it cant hurt so try it, i say!"

My face is really starting to clear, and I'm seeing the glow that other reviewers have talked about. In the past I have tried eating healthier, taking tons of supplements and using all sorts of ointments, benzoyl peroxide, salycic acid. Nothing cleared my skin. There are several factors here. First I was a heavy coffee drinker and for those that don't know, coffee is very acidic inside your body. Stopping coffee helps, plus all the unneeded cream and sugar in my cup. Sugar and dairy should also be avoided for clearer skin. This tea is naturally sweetened with stevia, I think it's sweet enough by itself. If this tea is not sweet enough for you I would recommend adding extra stevia, or honey. Just avoid using white bleached processed sugar and artificial toxic sweeteners, like Sweet and low, Equal, and Splenda. One other thing, your body will heal itself. Avoid, washing your face more than twice a day and applying<br />lots of products. If you wouldn't eat it don't apply it to your skin, your body absorbs all those chemicals.<br /> I believe that cutting way back on coffee, and replacing your caffeine source to a green tea will have a dramatic affect on your complexion. That being said, the glowing has to be some ingredient in this tea.<br />I have been alternating between Yogi skin detox and Yogi super green antioxidants, for over a week. I haven't broken out<br />badly sense drinking this tea, well one or two pimples,  but they are nowhere near as large and painful as before, they also seem to be healing faster. Hopefully after a few weeks I will start seeing even better results. Also shaving for the past few days has been easier, my skin feels less dry and the razor glides over my face with less irritation."

It was very clear moist and supple like high school days. Much clearer complexion unnoticeable pores. Perfect.<br />I think clearing my diet and food intake really allowed the tea to do it's work.

295120,B002LL7OXM,A24MDFNVB23FYL,Ms. LinaB,1,1,5,1348963200,Something Finally Works for my Skin!!!!!!!,"First of all, I must admit that this is my very first product review.  Usually, I have never taken the time to provide any type of feedback on products; however, I had to make an exception this time.  I didn't believe skin detox tea would work, even after I read the reviews so I purchased one box of Yogi DeTox tea from a local store since they didn't have the skin detox kind.  Well after drinking it, I noticed a difference the very next day, but it made my stomach hurt.  I just assumed that it was ridding my body of toxins.  About 2 weeks later, I ordered the Skin DeTox tea from Amazon because I couldn't find it anywhere else.  I wish I had taken before and after pictures because the results are amazing.  My skin has not looked this good in years and I have only been drinking this tea for about a month now, two weeks of the detox tea and about 2 weeks of the skin detox tea.  The only reason I took so long to write this review is because I thought that after a few days, my bumps would return.  Well so far so good...I have 2 or 3 bumps on my entire face, but I use to have acne all over my face until I started drinking the skin detox tea.  Everyday, the bumps are getting smaller and smaller.  I use to put all kinds of creams and dermatologist recommended ointments all over my face, but lately I've only been using the Cetaphil antibacterial soap and drinking the skin detox tea every morning.  I use two tea bags a day which makes me one large cup of tea.  I guess it really equates to about two regular size cups of tea a day.  I really pray that it continues to work for me because I'm so happy about the look of my skin and haven't felt so good in years.  Anyway, just order it and try it.  If it worked for me, then it bet it will do some good for you too.  Plus, it's cheaper than all of the other acne products on the market that do absolutely nothing at all.  Oh, the acne on my chest and back is completely gone and I've noticed a glow of my skin all over my body.  I hope this review helps somebody to at least give this tea a try.  I never thought that my acne would clear up by just drinking some tea, but I am so glad it did. Oh, some of the other reviews talked about the tea having a bad taste.  Well it tastes really good to me and I would drink muddy water if it would clear my skin.  That's how bad I've been wanting to have nice skin.  The taste is not bad at all, I add a little honey and I love it, but if you don't like it, I bet you will continue to drink it once you see what it can do for your skin."

I've had acne for a decade and have tried various topical meds...even birth control didn't make much of a difference. But I drink one cup of tea with two teabags every day, and i sometimes swab the tea on my face with a cotton ball. My skin is so much smoother and i hardly ever break out anymore. it's been a miracle!"

Coob,1,1,5,1341273600,works when used with other products,"I'm 43, female, have had mild cystic acne off and on for 17 years, and in the last few years my go-to remedies (antibiotics and Retin-A) completely stopped working. Two months ago, my acne was getting so bad that I didn't want to leave the house. Since no ""one"" product had ever worked, I decided to try three products together, and 4 weeks later, my acne is gone. Here are the three products: Yogi Skin DeTox Tea, Acne Free Maximum Strength, and the 0.5mm MT Skin Roller. It took a full 4 weeks to get consistently clear skin. I did get one bump around the two week mark, and I had some old bumps that took a full 4 weeks to clear up. Here's what to do:<br /><br />1. Drink two cups of Skin DeTox tea daily.(Tastes great hot or cold.)<br />2.Use the Maximum Strength Acne Free system morning and night.<br />3. At night, use the MT Roller once a week all over your face over the Acne Free Retinol Complex. Apply a little extra Retinol Complex to problem areas after rolling.<br />4. At night, use the MT Roller over the Retinol Complex every other day between weekly rollings ONLY on problem areas. You can stop doing this once the problems clear up, or roll only when problems surface.<br />5. After the first four weeks, continue to use the roller weekly with the Retinol Complex or other products to remove old acne scars.<br />6. Use a 15-30 spf sunscreen daily. The roller and Retinol Complex will increase sun sensitivity.<br /><br /> I used the DeTox tea and Acne Free products for two weeks without rolling, and I saw improvements to my skin tone and texture right away, but the deep cysts remained. It wasn't until I started rolling with the MT Roller that the cysts started shrinking or came to the surface of the skin.<br /><br />I hope this works for other people, particularly people over 40. The MT Roller will be too harsh on 20-something skin. Go easy with the roller if you are under 40 and roll less frequently. Keep a sanitary environment when rolling and clean your roller afterward. Don't roll on broken skin or white pustules. See other websites on how to use and clean your roller. I soak mine in alcohol for 15 minutes after rolling."

Usually this is an all-summer problem for me and I've tried a bunch of different lotions and other remedies to try and clear it up. This is the first thing that actually worked. We just had a 95+ degree heat wave in my state and my skin is as smooth as ever! I couldn't be happier. I was honestly not expecting this to work, but it completely does.<br /><br />As for the glowing skin and blemish-free face, I cannot say. I don't normally have bad acne to start with, but I have noticed that any little issues that pop up aren't really as red as they could be, which is certainly a bonus as I wasn't really drinking this tea for that. I can't vouch for my skin glowing, but then, what does that even really mean?<br /><br />The flavor is pretty boring. It tastes somewhere between air and green tea. It does smell tasty, though.<br /><br />Tip: If you're using this for a specific problem, then you might want to consider applying the used tea bags directly onto your skin, letting it dry and then gently rinsing it away. It certainly doesn't hurt, and I feel it definitely has been helping me out."

After drinking 1-2 tea bags for a couple of weeks, I started to notice some skin improvement in terms of clarity.  But my acne was still there, maybe to a less degree than before.<br /><br />More recently, I started to use a little bit of the hot tea as skin toner in the early evening before I drink the tea(by using a cotton pad to wipe through the entire face), and wash it off before bedtime.  I have been acne free ever since (for more than one month)!<br /><br />This tea is also relaxing.  I can drink it at night without losing sleep.  It actually improved my sleeping quality for the begining few weeks but later the sleeping benefit was not as dramatic.<br /><br />I did not like its taste at the beginning but with time I start to like it more and more."

But if you're unsure if you want to commit to a whole case of the stuff, I'd buy a box at the store and test it out, because a case is a huge price savings in my CT area of about about $1.50 a box, but it's an expensive loss if it turns out you don't like it.

It had this wonderful sweet-meaty taste and texture.  Yum! After eating it a couple times, I started CRAVING it.  I thought it was some type of pickled pork until I looked it up online; it is a root vegetable, and it has many beneficial effects including antiviral and antibacterial properties.  Then, I looked closer at the package and there were warning about it containing Saccharine.  So, I went on a search for other stuff with burdock root in it.<br />Yogi is my favorite tea-maker.  When I saw they have a tea with burdock root - I ordered a bunch. If it were made by any other company I would be happy with it.  But, this is a YOGI tea, and the taste is not the utterly amazing type of taste I've come to love from Yogi. It's not bad, just not up to par with Egyptian Licorice or Aztec Sweet Chili, neither of which need anything to make them taste perfect; no lemon, honey, sugar, or milk.<br />It tastes like something that should be labeled ""mixed berry black tea"" from bigelow or lipton. With sugar and lemon, it tastes like sweet-tart candies.<br />I continue to drink it because it does seem to be helping my skin - but I always feel sad reaching past the other Yogi teas to grab this one - the others just taste so wonderful."

Pingshui tea market records date as far back as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907). The area's gunpowder tea was an important tribute traditionally given to the Chinese emperors; and with the growing trade volume between China and the West it also acquired an increasing number of lovers in Europe. Particularly during the second half of the 19th century, when gunpowder tea export reached its peak, its price on the London market was second only to then-popular Wu Yi Oolong (also from China). Even today, Zhejiang Province still proudly calls itself ""home of silk and tea"" for its two primary natural products.<br /><br />The name ""gunpowder"" derives from the tea's elaborate method of processing, which traditionally lasts several hours and during which the tea leaves are withered, steamed or stir-fried and individually rolled into small pellets. Early foreign traders mistook these pellets for gunpowder or gunshot.<br /><br />Gunpowder tea has a delicate aroma with a slightly smokey note. It should *always* be enjoyed without milk or cream."

Yummy in Pumpkin Spice Tea,"I have a strong family history of type 2 diabetes and though for the past 10 years, I've mostly eaten foods with good glycemic index ratings, despite my efforts, recently I was diagnosed with type II diabetes.<br /><br />It's very hard to find anything sweet that is truly safe for diabetics because many products that call themselves sugar-free contain maltodextrin - like powdered sugar free jello, sugar free liquid coffee creamers, etc. Just last week I had to have some labs done and some days I noticed my BG (blood glucose) ratings were all over the place though I had not thought I'd eaten or drank anything that was on my list of foods to avoid. On the day I had the labs I'd only had fat free clear chicken broth and sugar free Jello that I made from a box mix. For some reason my BG was high. How?? When I'd only had jello and chicken broth for over 24 hours (I was a bit under the weather so that's why I was eating almost nothing).<br /><br />Anyway, I had the lab test my BG on their lab equipment and from the same blood sample I used my meter. The meter said 183. The lab test was 186! I later found out it was from the maltodextrin in the jello. Even the powdered Splenda that measures like sugar has maltodextrin in it. If you are ingesting maltodextrin, then your pancreas is working to ""clear"" it from your body just as it would have to do with table sugar is what I've been told by my endocrinologist. My GP (general practitioner) doctor didn't mention that, nor did my diabetes educator. I'm not sure they even know.<br /><br />Sorry for all the ""extraneous"" info but I just think it's important info to know if you are diabetic, pre-diabetic, have family history of diabetes or just don't want to burn out the beta cells in your pancreas then AVOID maltodextrin. According to the ingredient list, this product does not use maltodextrin.<br /><br />I ordered this syrup because I love the taste of brown sugar and thought I'd eventually find a use for it. It's okay in coffee but it's absolutely YUMMY in Stash brand Pumpkin Spice tea. It's like having a dessert and for me, it totally satisfies when I want something sweet. Since the tea is caffeine free and the syrup truly is safe for me, I can have it pretty much whenever I want.<br /><br />So long as they keep making this, I'm going to buy it."

I think if I dial it back, it will work better, or maybe a different combination. Most of the other syrups work very well in cocktails.<br /><br />This variety will be regularly stocked in my kitchen from now on."

The mint leaves are dried and they are a bit weak. When steeped for too long or if too much tea is used, the tea gets very bitter.

I love the way it seems to settle my stomach. It's become a regular after-dinner tea. I received it as a gift, and while I have tasted some teas with a stronger, oilier mint flavor, this one is nice in that it doesn't have the essential oil floating in it that can sometimes irritate the lips or the stomach. This has the real mint leaves dried in the tea to steep. Adding a few sprigs/leaves of fresh mint to the tea and lightly mottling/crushing them in the cup right before adding the water makes a huge difference and really enhances this tea.<br /><br />But even without that, this is a great tea, high quality green tea, delicate flavor. Just don't use too much of the tea so it doesn't get bitter. As for steeping time, I just throw the spoonful in with the hot water loose, so I steep it the whole time I'm sipping it and it doesn't get bitter or lose flavor at all.

It is also more persistent which means that you don't want to spray it close to plants you value.<br /><br />Triclopyr is what you need to knock out Poison Ivy. Poison Ivy and a lot of other shrubs or trees can take a swig of Glyphosate (Round Up), gargle twice with it and spit it back into your face just for giggles.  I've used this and the Bayer Brush Killer Plus.  They contain the same active ingredient and I haven't observed any significant difference.<br /><br />This stuff is the real deal - I found it when I was trying to locate a product called Vine-X (discontinued?) and found out that it was 13.6% Triclopyr in a penetrating oil.  You simply brush it onto cuts or active vines and it would kill the entire plant.<br /><br />This is where it is really nice to buy the concentrate instead of the pre-mix.  I spray the diluted version but also use the concentrate in a small bottle.  If I cut a thicker vine or trunk, I simply drip the concentrate on it and it will kill the roots and vine.  Besides PI we also have wild grapevine, Buckthorn, Box Elder, and many other invasive and nuisance plans in the woods.<br /><br />Because Poison Ivy is a creeping vine with multiple roots along it's length, eradication is helped with a higher concentration than the label instructs. (My observation) I use it between 50% to 100% (double) strength.<br /><br />It appears that if you spray it in one spot you will kill that part of the vine, but if you hit it (in enough places) with something strong enough you can kill the whole plant down to the roots.<br /><br />Make sure you spray it when you think it won't rain for at least a couple of days or else you will probably need to spray it again. Make sure you get all ""sprouts.""

Brush-B-Gone is also very selective; I have not had any neighboring plants die, and there is sometimes a little bit of overspray. It's also effective for other invasives I have: bittersweet and porcelain berry. Plus it is also a terrific stump rotter. I had a tree stump 3 feet in diameter.

(and oily),"A longtime fan of Nong Shim's excellent and popular spicy <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LQLV7E"">Nong Shim Shin Noodle Ramyun</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LQJT5K"">Nong Shim Kimchi Noodle Ramyun</a>, I was curious to try something different. And different it is. This is the first Nong Shim product I didn't take a liking to right away.<br /><br />Chapagetti is ""chajang"" + ""spaghetti"", chajang myun (noodle) being a Korean interpretation of a Chinese dish. Chajang literally means ""fried sauce"". It's a thick, black, soybean paste that's slightly sweet. For the instant version, Nong Shim replaced the paste with a mix-in powder. Inside the bag are 3 flavoring packs: a packet of sauce powder, an oil packet, and a dehydrated vegetables packet. Preparation is easy. Just add the vegetable pack to the noodles when cooking, drain, then add the other 2 packets and stir well before eating. The instructions say you need to boil the noodles in a pot for several minutes, but just pouring boiling water on the noodles and letting them rehydrate works just as well. I add the vegetable pack after I've drained the noodles so as not to pour it all out accidentally with the water. The residual heat and moisture will reconstitute the ingredients.<br /><br />The first time I tried this, I added everything. It tasted very oily and the powder seemed to be too much compared to the quantity of noodles. The noodle platform is hearty, thick, and elastic, like Nong Shim is well-known for, but I particularly dislike the oil because it made them greasy and runny. Now, I add half a bag of the powder and discard the oil, saving a few calories along the way and cutting down on some sodium. The tangy taste is very similar to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OEH48W"">Myojo Ippei-chan Instant Yakisoba Noodles</a> and other Japanese instant yakisoba because of the same Chinese culinary influence.<br /><br />Chapagetti contains less than 1/2 the sodium of the regular spicy Nong Shim ramen, so as a quick meal, it's not as bad for you. You can also add cooked cabbage and slices of chicken or other meats to bulk up the meal and make it more filling, as well as improve the nutritional value.<br /><br />Verdict: still a good noodle, but it may not be what some shoppers are expecting."

It not only tastes great but also has about half the sodium content of the others (40% vs. >90% for whole package). It's not healthy per se, but is probably a lot better for you. The dried veggies seem more substantial than the mere onion flakes in the other packs; this one has carrots, some tofu-like pieces, and green things. The sauce is also more savory than salty which is a good change of pace. Just be warned that it's korean style chajang noodles with a dark sauce. The sauce is a bit difficult to mix evenly and tends to clump up, so sprinkle it evenly on the noodles when you mix rather than just dumping it all on one spot."

I recommend having the noodles in the cold water as you bring it up to a boil. For some reason it adds another level and the noodles come out tasting better."

I make it the way I usually do to a normal instant noodle and hated its taste, but wait! It was not until the last couple packs when I realized THE CORRECT WAY to make these noodles, and they are delicious if you make it the right way.<br /><br />Notice that it is called Chajiang noodle, which means it's not noodle in a soup.The right way to make the noodle is, you put the noodle in a bowl, pour in boiling water and wait. Don't put in the seasoning package yet. When the noodle is ready, pour out the water, and then add the pack of seasoning. The remaining moisture on the noodle will turn the powder into a thick sauce, and you mix well and serve. It's the same way you make Low-Mein if you know what I am talking about.<br /><br />So, this is actually good-tasting noodles if you read the instructions on the package and do it correctly.

295261,B000LQNK50,AA4GC72H2UZQ4,"Big Momma ""Big Momma's House""",2,2,5,1247529600,good price for quick meal or snack - tastes good too!,Noodles go fast in our house. What makes one noodle bowl better than another is how fast you can have something tasty and hot with little preparation. This noodle is just that - quick and tasty!
295262,B000LQNK50,A10TK45PL2YNQ2,Deal Chaser,4,5,5,1214352000,Great taste!,"Tasty Korean noodle. There must be nothing like this from any other manufacturers. It was even cheaper than other Asian markets. However, if you have not tried this before, I would recommend you to try a single pack first before purchasing a box. This noodle is a bit different taste to the other typical ramyuns (ramens). I would say it is better than the other typical ones."
295263,B000LQNK50,AD0LGVE8O4GQ3,Emily Wind,1,1,5,1332806400,Filling and delicious,"These noodles came out of the microwave smelling fantastic. I then strained off a lot of the water down to what seemed right, and added the soup base and oil packets. I tried a bit of each of these and the soup base had a taste simlar to cocoa at the time, and the oil tasted nice as well. I was quite intruiged to get things together and see how it tasted.<br /><br />It tasted utterly fantastic. I am not sure how people could not like these noodles, but then again I am not a picky eater. At the same time though, these are probably the best tasting packaged noodles I have had, alongside others such as Shin Ramyun and etc. These also have left me full for several hours.<br /><br />Some reviewers say that you may not like these if you are not Asian, but I am not and love them nonetheless. It might depend on how much Asian cuisine you have eaten and how picky you are though. Those who generally eat Westernised Asian dishes like general tso's may be in for a surprise; pleasent or otherwise. :D<br /><br />Five stars for being tasty and quality packaged noodles. Cannot ask for much more at this price."

295266,B000LQNK50,A33ZDGK0S4ETQS,ted,1,1,4,1328054400,good but not for everyone,"This noodle is great and tasty but it is not for everyone to enjoy, maybe more for the Asians. Anyway just try it~"
295267,B000LQNK50,ASVMD19XFJEDB,Steve R,1,1,4,1321920000,Chicago style Lo-mien,"Very Tasty, trying to figure the flavor out. Almost like Chicago style lo-mien. the brown noodles at the Chinese restaurant. Little complicated to make compared with other rammon but worth it. I will reorder it."
295268,B000LQNK50,A1ONH5LWTVV5UU,MikeInOhio,1,1,4,1321833600,What does it taste like?,"In each package of Nong Shim Chapagetti you'll find a round-shaped block of noodles and three packets; some dried vegetables, some gravy granules and some oil.<br /><br />When prepared according to the directions there is no broth,  just thick, dark,  black-bean gravy.<br /><br />So, what does it taste like?  Imagine a deep dark beef gravy mixed with ramen noodles and you'll be close.  It's not spicy at all.  The taste reminds me of eating mashed potatoes and gravy at the local diner.<br /><br />I like it as a change of pace from other packaged ramen noodles."

295271,B000LQNK50,ACL99Q8EHCK6M,A. Stribling,0,0,2,1350518400,Not a fan,"This is a review of the bowl version of Nong Shim's Chapagetti. I've had noodles with black bean paste before at several Korean restaurants, but the flavor on this one is just off. I've tried using the amount of water in the instructions as well as tossing the drained noodles in the flavor packet. Either way, the flavor ranges from bland to bitter. I'll stick with their chicken or beef."
